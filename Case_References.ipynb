    "\n",
    "\tIn September 2000, Superior went into liquidation and CIGA assumed administration of Superior's claims. On November 9, 2001, CIGA filed a petition to join Flavurence Corporation as the employer at the time of injury and its insurance carrier Fremont. CIGA also requested to be dismissed as a party defendant based on Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9). We note in this petition for joinder that CIGA indicated that applicant alleged two specific injuries occurring on June 21, 1998 and September 11, 1998. But, only a single case number is listed (LAO 778749). In his Report and Recommendation on Fremont's Petition for Reconsideration, the WCJ without explanation also refers to these two specific injury dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tIt appears that at the time of the alleged injury dates in 1998, applicant was working as a packer. However, there is a potential general and special employment issue existing under Insurance Code section 116632 as well as the issue of Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9). [sup]2[/sup] Insurance Code section 11663 provides, in pertinent part: \"As between insurers of general and special employers, one which insures the liability of the general employer is liable for the entire cost of compensation payable on account of injury occurring in the course of and arising out of general and special employments unless the special employer had the employee on his or her payroll at the time of injury, in which case the insurer of the special employer is solely liable.\" , Fremont alleges that at the time of the injury, Parker Personnel, Inc., as a temporary employment agency, had placed applicant for a temporary assignment at Flavurence Corporation. It appears that Superior, now in liquidation, was the workers' compensation insurance carrier for Parker Personnel Inc. and that Fremont was the carrier for Flavurence Corporation. Fremont alleges a general and special employment issue exists under Insurance Code section 11663, whereas CIGA asserts that at the time of the injury that applicant was jointly employed by Parker Personnel, Inc. and Flavurence Corporation, which would relieve it of any liability under Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tAt the Mandatory Settlement Conference held on December 3, 2001 pursuant to Labor Code section 5502(d), the WCJ joined Fremont as a party defendant and, over Fremont's objection, dismissed as party defendant CIGA for Superior National Insurance Company in liquidation, and its administrator Integrated Claims Administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThis led to the instant petition for reconsideration filed by Fremont. Fremont, on behalf of the alleged special employer, alleges that Superior, and subsequently CIGA, had accepted the injury (presumably injury of July 21, 1998) and was paying benefits. It is not clear if benefits continue to be \"administered\" in light of the aforementioned dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tIn his January 3, 2002 Report and Recommendation on the petition, the WCJ recommends that Fremont's petition be denied based upon his interpretation and application of Insurance Code section 11663 where Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9) applies. The WCJ interprets and applies Insurance Code section 11663 as only applying between \"insurers\" and not between employers. CIGA is not an insurer.

    "[center]II. DISCUSSION[/center]\n",
    "\n",
    "\tCIGA asserts in both of the above entitled cases that it should be dismissed since there is \"other insurance\" and thus it has no liability pursuant to Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9). CIGA cites [i][highlight=rgb(255, 255, 0)]Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, California[/highlight][/i]\n",
    "[i][highlight=rgb(255, 255, 0)]Insurance Guarantee Association (Garcia)[/highlight][/i] (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 548 [62 Cal.Comp.Cases 1661] in support of its position.   , It is true that under certain circumstances dismissal of CIGA is an appropriate disposition. Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9)(i) provides that \"'[c]overed claims' [do] not include any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by this article [14.2] available to the claimant or insured [.]\" This section was applied in Garcia, supra, where the employee filed a worker's compensation claim for cumulative injury from November 6, 1990 through November 6, 1991, during which time the employer had three successive workers' compensation carriers. Before trial, one carrier became insolvent and CIGA sought dismissal from the employee Garcia's case, asserting that the claim was not a \"covered claim\" under Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9) because \"other\" workers' compensation insurance was available through the other two jointly and severally liable carriers. The WCJ denied CIGA's request for dismissal and issued awards proportionate to the time of coverage of the three carriers. The Board reversed and substituted a joint and several award against the remaining two carriers, concluding that the employee's claim was covered by other insurance because all carriers during the period of exposure were jointly and severally liable for benefits and hence the employee's claim was not a \"covered claim\" under section 1063.1(c)(9). The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding, in pertinent part:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Garcia had the substantive right to collect his entire benefit award from Industrial and SCIF since each was jointly and severally liable. Since Garcia's benefits claim was fully protected by solvent insurers Industrial and SCIF, both Garcia and his employer had 'other insurance' available within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c). Hence, the award favoring Garcia against Industrial and SCIF did not constitute a statutorily-defined 'covered claim.' (id. At subd. (c)(9).) Accordingly, the Board properly determined CIGA had no statutory liability for any portion of Garcia's award [Footnote omitted.]\" (62 Cal.Comp.Cases 1661 at 1669)\n",
    "\n",
    "\tCIGA's reliance upon Garcia, supra, is not helpful. Unlike the instant cases, in Garcia there was no dispute regarding the date of injury versus the date of last injurious exposure, or other threshold issue which if determined adversely against CIGA would result in liability of CIGA. In Garcia there were three carriers in the period of liability under Labor Code section 5500.5 with one becoming insolvent after a joint and several award; therefore CIGA was properly dismissed as a party defendant since it was undisputed that there were two other carriers jointly liable during the   , period also covered by the insolvent carrier. It was clearly not a \"covered claim\" under Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9) as far as CIGA's liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tIn both of the cases before us, unlike the situation in Garcia, supra, there are underlying issues which if decided adversely against CIGA would establish its liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tWCAB Case No. AHM 075204 (SINGH) involves alleged cumulative trauma injury claim under Labor Code section 5500.5. There has been no determination of the date of injury or period of injurious exposure based on submission of evidence; therefore, the date of injury under section 5500.5 has yet to be determined. It is well settled that for the purposes of liability under Labor section 5500.5, the relevant date is either the date of injury as defined by Labor Code section 5412, or the year immediately preceding the date of last injurious exposure, whichever occurs first. (See, [i][highlight=rgb(255, 255, 0)]Western Growers Insurance Co. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (Austin)[/highlight][/i] (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227 [58 Cal.Comp.Cases 323, 331]; [i][highlight=rgb(255, 255, 0)]Aetna Cas. & Surety Co. v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. (Coltharp)[/highlight][/i] (1973) 35 Cal. App.3d 329 [38 Cal. Comp. Cases 720].)\n",
    "\n",
    "\tApplicant SINGH initially alleged cumulative trauma injury during a period that the now insolvent carrier was the only carrier on the risk, but later alleged injury during a period that both Republic and the insolvent carrier were on the risk. Against the latter claim, Republic has raised a statute of limitation defense that has not been determined. It has not been determined on evidence whether the date of injury is outside of Republic's coverage and only within the insolvent carrier's coverage or whether the statute of limitation defense will prevail. These are threshold issues which if decided adversely to CIGA, would establish CIGA's liability. Accordingly, it is premature to dismiss CIGA under these circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tWe recognize that in a situation where the parties stipulate to the elements of date of injury for purposes of Labor Code section 5412, thereby identifying the potential entities that may be liable in the event that injury is found, then CIGA may be dismissed. However, this would likely be the exception, rather than the rule, an issue not presently before us. Therefore, the WCJ's order dismissing CIGA in WCAB Case No. AHM 075204 (SINGH) will be rescinded and the matter returned to the trial level.   , .\n",
    "\tLikewise, in WCAB Case No. LAO 778749 (MANZANO) there are issues which if decided adversely to CIGA, would result in CIGA's liability, unlike the situation in Garcia, supra. It is disputed whether a general/special employment relationship exists under Insurance Code section 11663, whether section 11663 is applicable to CIGA, or whether at the time of the alleged injury applicant was jointly employed by Parker Personnel, Inc. and Flavurence Corporation for purposes of the application of Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9). These underlying disputes need to be determined on evidence before entertaining a motion to dismiss CIGA as a party defendant. In addition, and as noted above, CIGA was previously paying benefits on this accepted injury and should continue to pay, subject to a determination of party liability, and CIGA may seek reimbursement depending on the ultimate disposition in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tIn passing we note that with respect to CIGA's potential liability pertaining to the issue of general/special employment and Insurance Code section 1063.1, parties may wish to delay litigation pending a disposition by WCJ Robert T. Hjelle of the Van Nuys District Office relating to Remedy Temp, Inc. and CIGA. We are informed that the narrow issue presented is CIGA's liability where a general/special employment relationship exists. We note that some two hundred cases have been consolidated and that it appears that two have been selected as representative cases for trial and decision. These matters are presently in the discovery stage with an MSC set for August 9, 2002, 10:00 a.m., and a trial date of September 13, 2002, 10:00 a.m.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tFinally, we observe that generally there should be a hearing and determination of the injured workers' entitlement to benefits and liability for same, before allowing potential defendants to be dismissed. This approach will avoid the necessity for joining and/or rejoining parties depending on the facts that develop in the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tFor reasons given above, we conclude that the orders dismissing CIGA in WCAB Case No. AHM 075204 (SINGH) and in WCAB Case No. LAO 778749 (MANZANO) should be rescinded and the matters returned to the trial level for further proceedings and decision consistent with the opinions express herein.\n",

We note in this petition for joinder that CIGA indicated that applicant alleged two specific injuries occurring on June 21, 1998 and September 11, 1998. But, only a single case number is listed (LAO 778749). In his Report and Recommendation on Fremont's Petition for Reconsideration, the WCJ without explanation also refers to these two specific injury dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIt appears that at the time of the alleged injury dates in 1998, applicant was working as a packer. However, there is a potential general and special employment issue existing under Insurance Code section 116632 as well as the issue of Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9). [sup]2[/sup] Insurance Code section 11663 provides, in pertinent part: \"As between insurers of general and special employers, one which insures the liability of the general employer is liable for the entire cost of compensation payable on account of injury occurring in the course of and arising out of general and special employments unless the special employer had the employee on his or her payroll at the time of injury, in which case the insurer of the special employer is solely liable.\" , Fremont alleges that at the time of the injury, Parker Personnel, Inc., as a temporary employment agency, had placed applicant for a temporary assignment at Flavurence Corporation. It appears that Superior, now in liquidation, was the workers' compensation insurance carrier for Parker Personnel Inc. and that Fremont was the carrier for Flavurence Corporation. Fremont alleges a general and special employment issue exists under Insurance Code section 11663, whereas CIGA asserts that at the time of the injury that applicant was jointly employed by Parker Personnel, Inc. and Flavurence Corporation, which would relieve it of any liability under Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9).\n",
      "\n",
      "\tAt the Mandatory Settlement Conference held on December 3, 2001 pursuant to Labor Code section 5502(d), the WCJ joined Fremont as a party defendant and, over Fremont's objection, dismissed as party defendant CIGA for Superior National Insurance Company in liquidation, and its administrator Integrated Claims Administrators.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThis led to the instant petition for reconsideration filed by Fremont. Fremont, on behalf of the alleged special employer, alleges that Superior, and subsequently CIGA, had accepted the injury (presumably injury of July 21, 1998) and was paying benefits. It is not clear if benefits continue to be \"administered\" in light of the aforementioned dismissal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn his January 3, 2002 Report and Recommendation on the petition, the WCJ recommends that Fremont's petition be denied based upon his interpretation and application of Insurance Code section 11663 where Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9) applies. The WCJ interprets and applies Insurance Code section 11663 as only applying between \"insurers\" and not between employers. CIGA is not an insurer. The WCJ also concludes that a year in delaying the joinder of Fremont is insufficient to support laches as asserted by Fremont.\n",

      "[center]II. DISCUSSION[/center]\n",
      "\n",
      "\tCIGA asserts in both of the above entitled cases that it should be dismissed since there is \"other insurance\" and thus it has no liability pursuant to Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9). CIGA cites [i][highlight=rgb(255, 255, 0)]Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, California[/highlight][/i]\n",
      "[i][highlight=rgb(255, 255, 0)]Insurance Guarantee Association (Garcia)[/highlight][/i] (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 548 [62 Cal.Comp.Cases 1661] in support of its position.   , It is true that under certain circumstances dismissal of CIGA is an appropriate disposition. Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9)(i) provides that \"'[c]overed claims' [do] not include any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by this article [14.2] available to the claimant or insured [.]\" This section was applied in Garcia, supra, where the employee filed a worker's compensation claim for cumulative injury from November 6, 1990 through November 6, 1991, during which time the employer had three successive workers' compensation carriers. Before trial, one carrier became insolvent and CIGA sought dismissal from the employee Garcia's case, asserting that the claim was not a \"covered claim\" under Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9) because \"other\" workers' compensation insurance was available through the other two jointly and severally liable carriers. The WCJ denied CIGA's request for dismissal and issued awards proportionate to the time of coverage of the three carriers. The Board reversed and substituted a joint and several award against the remaining two carriers, concluding that the employee's claim was covered by other insurance because all carriers during the period of exposure were jointly and severally liable for benefits and hence the employee's claim was not a \"covered claim\" under section 1063.1(c)(9). The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding, in pertinent part:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Garcia had the substantive right to collect his entire benefit award from Industrial and SCIF since each was jointly and severally liable. Since Garcia's benefits claim was fully protected by solvent insurers Industrial and SCIF, both Garcia and his employer had 'other insurance' available within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c). Hence, the award favoring Garcia against Industrial and SCIF did not constitute a statutorily-defined 'covered claim.' (id. At subd. (c)(9).) Accordingly, the Board properly determined CIGA had no statutory liability for any portion of Garcia's award [Footnote omitted.]\" (62 Cal.Comp.Cases 1661 at 1669)\n",
      "\n",
      "\tCIGA's reliance upon Garcia, supra, is not helpful. Unlike the instant cases, in Garcia there was no dispute regarding the date of injury versus the date of last injurious exposure, or other threshold issue which if determined adversely against CIGA would result in liability of CIGA. In Garcia there were three carriers in the period of liability under Labor Code section 5500.5 with one becoming insolvent after a joint and several award; therefore CIGA was properly dismissed as a party defendant since it was undisputed that there were two other carriers jointly liable during the   , period also covered by the insolvent carrier. It was clearly not a \"covered claim\" under Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9) as far as CIGA's liability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn both of the cases before us, unlike the situation in Garcia, supra, there are underlying issues which if decided adversely against CIGA would establish its liability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWCAB Case No. AHM 075204 (SINGH) involves alleged cumulative trauma injury claim under Labor Code section 5500.5. There has been no determination of the date of injury or period of injurious exposure based on submission of evidence; therefore, the date of injury under section 5500.5 has yet to be determined. It is well settled that for the purposes of liability under Labor section 5500.5, the relevant date is either the date of injury as defined by Labor Code section 5412, or the year immediately preceding the date of last injurious exposure, whichever occurs first. (See, [i][highlight=rgb(255, 255, 0)]Western Growers Insurance Co. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (Austin)[/highlight][/i] (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227 [58 Cal.Comp.Cases 323, 331]; [i][highlight=rgb(255, 255, 0)]Aetna Cas. & Surety Co. v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. (Coltharp)[/highlight][/i] (1973) 35 Cal. App.3d 329 [38 Cal. Comp. Cases 720].)\n",
      "\n",
      "\tApplicant SINGH initially alleged cumulative trauma injury during a period that the now insolvent carrier was the only carrier on the risk, but later alleged injury during a period that both Republic and the insolvent carrier were on the risk. Against the latter claim, Republic has raised a statute of limitation defense that has not been determined. It has not been determined on evidence whether the date of injury is outside of Republic's coverage and only within the insolvent carrier's coverage or whether the statute of limitation defense will prevail. These are threshold issues which if decided adversely to CIGA, would establish CIGA's liability. Accordingly, it is premature to dismiss CIGA under these circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWe recognize that in a situation where the parties stipulate to the elements of date of injury for purposes of Labor Code section 5412, thereby identifying the potential entities that may be liable in the event that injury is found, then CIGA may be dismissed. However, this would likely be the exception, rather than the rule, an issue not presently before us. Therefore, the WCJ's order dismissing CIGA in WCAB Case No. AHM 075204 (SINGH) will be rescinded and the matter returned to the trial level.   , .\n",
      "\tLikewise, in WCAB Case No. LAO 778749 (MANZANO) there are issues which if decided adversely to CIGA, would result in CIGA's liability, unlike the situation in Garcia, supra. It is disputed whether a general/special employment relationship exists under Insurance Code section 11663, whether section 11663 is applicable to CIGA, or whether at the time of the alleged injury applicant was jointly employed by Parker Personnel, Inc. and Flavurence Corporation for purposes of the application of Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(9). These underlying disputes need to be determined on evidence before entertaining a motion to dismiss CIGA as a party defendant. In addition, and as noted above, CIGA was previously paying benefits on this accepted injury and should continue to pay, subject to a determination of party liability, and CIGA may seek reimbursement depending on the ultimate disposition in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn passing we note that with respect to CIGA's potential liability pertaining to the issue of general/special employment and Insurance Code section 1063.1, parties may wish to delay litigation pending a disposition by WCJ Robert T. Hjelle of the Van Nuys District Office relating to Remedy Temp, Inc. and CIGA. We are informed that the narrow issue presented is CIGA's liability where a general/special employment relationship exists. We note that some two hundred cases have been consolidated and that it appears that two have been selected as representative cases for trial and decision. These matters are presently in the discovery stage with an MSC set for August 9, 2002, 10:00 a.m., and a trial date of September 13, 2002, 10:00 a.m.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tFinally, we observe that generally there should be a hearing and determination of the injured workers' entitlement to benefits and liability for same, before allowing potential defendants to be dismissed. This approach will avoid the necessity for joining and/or rejoining parties depending on the facts that develop in the record.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tFor reasons given above, we conclude that the orders dismissing CIGA in WCAB Case No. AHM 075204 (SINGH) and in WCAB Case No. LAO 778749 (MANZANO) should be rescinded and the matters returned to the trial level for further proceedings and decision consistent with the opinions express herein.\n",
