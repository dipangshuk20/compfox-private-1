    "Pursuant to Labor Code section 5705, “The burden of proof rests upon the party or lien claimant\n",
    "holding the affirmative of the issue.” (Lab. Code, § 5705.) A lien claimant has the burden of proving all\n",
    "elements necessary to establish the validity of its lien. Labor Code section 3202.5 states that, “All parties\n",
    "and lien claimants shall meet the evidentiary burden of proof on all issues by a preponderance of the\n",
    "evidence.” (Lab. Code, §3202.5; Hand Rehabilitation Center v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (Obernier)\n",
    "(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1204, 1212-1213 [60 Cal.Comp.Cases 289, 291-292].) A lien claimant treating\n",

    "“reasonably required to cure or relieve” the injured worker from the effects of an industrial injury. (Lab.\n",

    "\n",
    "Absent stipulations regarding the alleged injuries and the injured body parts, lien claimant must\n",
    "prove that applicant sustained an injury AOE/COE. In her Report, the WCJ explained in detail that lien\n",
    "claimant did not meet its burden of proof regarding injury AOE/COE. (Report, pp. 4 — 6.) We reviewed\n",
    "the entire record, and based thereon we agree with the WCJ that lien claimant did not prove that applicant\n",
    "sustained injury AOE/COE. Having failed to establish the threshold issue of injury AOE/COE, the\n",
    "remaining issues raised in lien claimant’s Petition are moot. However, we will address those issues to\n",

    "a critical component of his determination.” (Petition, EAMS p. 4.) We first note that Dr. Weiss reviewed\n",
    "a substantial amount of medical records, including several MRIs and other diagnostics, as he explained in\n",
    "his twelve page summary of medical records. (Def. Exh. C, 3/16/2016, pp. 1 — 13.) Also, lien claimant\n",
    "did not identify what records were not submitted to the doctor for his review. The record contains no\n",
    "evidence as to what additional medical records lien claimant is referring to. Absent evidence of what the\n",
    "complete medical record would include, the argument is speculation, not evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lien claimant also argues that Dr. Weiss apportioned “causation of the injury” to impermissible\n",
    "risk factors. (Petition, EAMS pp. 5 — 6.) Actually, Dr. Weiss did not address apportionment. He found\n",
    "there was no injury, thus there was no disability caused by the claimed injuries, and in turn, no\n",
    "apportionment. Causation of permanent disability is different than causation of injury. “Section 4663(a)’s\n",
    "statement that the apportionment of permanent disability shall be based on ‘causation’ refers to the\n",
    "causation of the permanent disability, not causation of the injury,...” (Escobedo v. Marshalls (2005) 70\n",
    "Cal.Comp.Cases 604, 607 (Appeals Board en banc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding lien claimant’s assertion that the PTP reports were substantial evidence, as the WCJ\n",
    "noted:\n",
    "\n",
    "The reports issued by petitioner were not found to constitute substantial\n",
    "evidence because as previously noted, they were incomplete, conclusory\n",
    "[sic] and without reason in most cases. ... In addition, the reports were\n",
    "missing information that should have been included such as the activities\n",
    "applicant was precluded from performing as noted in the Opinion on\n",
    "Decision... .\n",
    "\n",
    "(Report, p. 6.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, as noted above, lien claimant argued that the report from Dr. Weiss is not substantial\n",
    "evidence because he didn’t review the entire medical record. However, the PTP report that lien claimant\n",
    "says is substantial evidence that applicant sustained injury AOE/COE (L.C. Exh. 2, Dr. Sabbaghi,\n",
    "9/21/2016) indicates that the only medical record the PTP had reviewed was the March 28, 2016 report\n",
    "from Dr. Weiss. Clearly, the PTP did not review the entire medical record so lien claimant’s arguments\n",
    "are factually inconsistent with the trial record.\n",

    "duties.” At his deposition applicant repeatedly stated that he did not report the alleged injury to the\n",
    "employer. (e.g. see Def. Exh. A; L.C. Exh. 4; pages 35-38.) When asked “Did you tell anybody about\n",
    "your injury on May 8, 2011?” applicant answered “No, I did not.” Then asked, “You didn’t tell anyone at\n",
    "work that it happened?” he answered, “No.” (p. 44.) He was later asked, “So did you ever tell Mr. Lee or\n",
    "Mr. Chen that you injured yourself pushing the boxes on May 8, 2011?” He answered “No, I did not.” He\n",
    "was then asked “Did you ever tell them about the injury at any later date?” His answer was “No. No. I\n",
    "was hoping that - - that I get treatment and then, you know, heal and go away, and I’ll be able to go back\n",
    "to work again. (p. 45.) Applicant’s later testimony (pp. 46 — 47) indicates that he told the employer about\n",
    "his symptoms and treatment but he did not ever claim a work injury. Again, lien claimant’s argument\n",
    "appears to be a misrepresentation of the evidence submitted at trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what lien claimant is arguing as to the statute of limitations. There is no finding that\n",
    "applicant’s injury claims were timely or that the claims were not timely. Also, since the WCJ found that\n",
    "there was no injury AOE/COE, there is no date of injury to trigger the statute of limitations, so as stated\n",
    "by the WC] in the Opinion on Decision, the issue is moot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, lien claimant’s assertion that it was denied its due process rights, is based on its\n",
    "arguments that because Dr. Weiss had retired it could not take his deposition and that it did not know\n",
    "defendant’s “position” regarding its lien. The argument that if lien claimant had the opportunity to “cross\n",
    "examine the AME [it] would have obtained a more favorable result” appears to be based solely on\n",
    "conjecture. Also, there is no evidence in the trial record which shows that lien claimant had tried to\n",
    "schedule the AME’s deposition and that the doctor refused to be deposed. Thus, there is no factual\n",
    "support for lien claimant’s argument. Nor is there evidence to support the argument that lien claimant\n",
    "was not given timely notice of defendant’s “position” regarding its lien. As the WCJ noted: “The\n",
    "allegation is stated without any evidence except to suggest that the lien claimant first knew of the\n",
    "defendant’s position at the lien conference on 5/1/18. That is false.” (Report, p. 8.) We noted above, that\n",
    "in his September 21, 2016 report, the PTP (Dr. Sabbaghi) stated that he “reviewed AME, Dr. Stephen\n",
    "Weiss’s report dated 3/28/2016...” wherein Dr. Weiss concluded that applicant did not sustain the\n",
    "\n",
    "injuries as claimed. (Petition, p. 8; see L.C. Exh. 2, Dr. Sabbaghi, 9/21/2016.) We agree with the WCJ’s\n",
