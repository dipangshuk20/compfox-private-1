A copy of the reply, if any, must be attached to the petition to\n25 dismiss. A copy of the petition must be served on all parties and all lien claimants.\n26 (Cal.

Applicant further\nargues that even if the LTD policy was in evidence, the terms of the policy do not support the award of\ncredit because it does not provide for coordination with workers’ compensation benefits. Finally, applicant\nargues that she is entitled to payment of temporary disability indemnity at the rate in effect on the date of\npayment, pursuant to Labor Code section 4661.5,\n\nAs of the date of this opinion, defendant has not filed an Answer to the Petition for Reconsideration.\nThe WCJ has prepared a Report and Recommendation on Petition for Reconsideration, in which he\n\nrecommends that applicant’s Petition for Reconsideration be denied.\n\foO ROUND OBB\n\na\nwn F&F WY NO\n\n16\n\n \n\nAs the allowance of credit to defendant against applicant’s temporary disability benefits was based\non the terms of the LTD policy, which was not entered into the record of this matter, we will grant\nreconsideration, rescind the Findings and Award and return this matter to the trial level to allow the WCJ\nto admit the LTD policy into evidence and make a determination on its applicability.\n\nI\n\nAt trial on September 4, 2019, defendant disputed applicant’s claim that she sustained an industrial\ncumulative trauma injury to her psyche, internal and sleep over the period February 10, 2009 through\nFebruary 10, 2010. Defendant raised an issue not included in the pre-trial conference statement, that it is\nentitled to credit against temporary disability for long term disability payments. As defendant had not raised\nthe credit issue at the Mandatory Settlement Conference, it did not list the LTD policy as an exhibit and\ndid not offer it into evidence at trial.\n\nThe parties were directed to file briefs regarding defendant’s claim for credit, which were filed by\nthe parties after the evidentiary record was closed. Defendant argued, inter alia, that it was entitled to credit\nfor the entire amount of payments made to applicant pursuant to the LTD policy. Defendant attached as\nexhibits to its trial brief its Employee Handbook and a Summary of Disability Payments made to applicant.\n\nIn her Petition for Reconsideration, applicant argues that the WCI erred in making a determination\non defendant’s entitlement to a credit based upon a LTD policy that was not offered or accepted into the\nrecord of proceedings.\n\nIn his Report and Recommendation on Petition for Reconsideration, the WCJ contends applicant is\nbeing disingenuous in arguing a violation of her due process rights, since applicant received the benefits\nof the LTD policy.\n\nIt was defendant’s late claim of credit, first raised on the day of trial, that led to this issue being\nconsidered without an evidentiary basis. While the issue has been fully briefed by the parties, it is\nincontrovertible that a determination cannot be made on defendant’s entitlement to credit based on the\nLTD policy if the policy is not in evidence.\n\nTherefore, we will grant reconsideration, rescind the Findings and Award and return this matter to\n\nthe trial level to allow the WCJ to enter the LTD policy into the record and to determine whether the\n\nAVOLA, Maria 2\n\f \n\noOo eo YI DBD NW BR WY PO ~~\n\nDOR Ree a a ee\n\n \n\nbenefits paid pursuant to the LTD policy were intended to replace workers’ compensation benefits,\n\npursuant to Labor Code section 4903.1(a)(3)(A).\n\nJf]\n\nAVOLA, Maria\n\f—\n\noe\nNy Dn VW FF Ww NY SK OD\n\n \n\noO Oo NI DH HW F&F W NV\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFor the foregoing reasons,\n\nIT IS ORDERED that the November 11, 2019 Petition for Reconsideration be, and hereby is,\nGRANTED, and as our Decision After Reconsideration, the Findings and Award, issued October 30, 2019,\nis RESCINDED, and the matter shall be RETURNED to the trial level for further proceedings and a new\n\nfinal decision.\n\nWORKERS’ COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD\n\nI CONCUR,\n\nDEIDRA E.

This is our decision after reconsideration.!\n\nApplicant Glen Dudley seeks reconsideration of the Finding of Fact issued by the workers’\ncompensation administrative law judge (WCJ) on October 16, 2017. The WCJ found, in pertinent part,\nthat applicant was not employed by defendant California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation\nInmate Claims.\n\nApplicant contends that he is an employee under Labor Code? section 3351(e), which describes\nan employee as all “persons incarcerated in a state penal or correctional institution while engaged in\nassigned work or employment as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 10021 of Title 8\nof the California Code of Regulations, or engaged in work performed under contract.” (§ 3351(e).)\n\nWe did not receive an Answer from defendant. We received a Report and Recommendation on\n\nPetition for Reconsideration (Report) from the WCJ recommending as follows, “[i]f the WCAB finds the\n\n \n\n' The Opinion and Order Granting Petition for Reconsideration was signed by former Commissioner\nFrank M. Brass, who retired. New panel member has been substituted in his place. .\n\n?

WCJ . . . recommends Applicant’s Petition... be\ngranted. Otherwise, the ...WCJ... recommends Applicant’s Petition .. . be denied.” (WCI’s Report,\np. 3.)\n\nWe have considered the allegations of the Petition, Answer, and the contents of the WCIJ’s\nReport. Based on our review of the record and, as discussed below, we amend the Finding of Fact to\nspecify that applicant is an employee of defendant for the relevant time period. We otherwise affirm the\n\nFinding of Fact.\n\nAs the WCJ stated:\n\nApplicant was incarcerated at Wasco State Prison-Reception Center\nduring the period [of] August 15, 2016 to November 21, 2016. The\nApplicant contacted Valley Fever during this period. Applicant claims to\nhave been [an] inmate labor[er] during this period and Defendant claims\nthat Applicant was a volunteer and would not be considered an employee\nfor the purposes of Workers’ Compensation. (Minutes of Hearing and\nSummary of Evidence Dated September 19, 2017, hereinafter MOH,\npages 2:4-7, 2:14).\n\n(WCJ’s Report, p. 1.)\n\nAt the September 19, 2017 trial, applicant testified that he volunteered to work in the kitchen at\nthe prison “because there was nothing else to do.” (Minutes of Hearing/Summary of Evidence\n(MOH/SOE) dated September 19, 2017, p. 6:19-20.) “If he did not volunteer, he was with the general\npopulation. He [could} work out or he could watch TV if he wanted.” (Jd. at p. 6:19-21.) Applicant\nunderstood he would not be paid when he volunteered to work in the kitchen. (Jbid.) But, in his Petition,\napplicant argues that he was aware that his prison time could be reduced for good behavior. (Petition, p.\n3,96.)\n\nApplicant further testified that inmates who wanted to volunteer in the kitchen would place their\nidentification cards in a box and an officer from the kitchen would draw from that box to take inmates to\nthe kitchen. (MOH/SOE dated September 19, 2017, pp. 5:24-6:3.) Work in the kitchen was from 8:00\na.m. or 9:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. with a break for lunch. (bid) Applicant’s job duties\n\nincluded washing meal trays with a water hose. (Jbid.)\n\nDUDLEY, Glen 2\n\n \n\f \n\n1\n\nFollowing the September 19, 2017 trial, the WCJ issued a Finding of Fact on October 16, 2017.\n\n2|| Applicant timely filed for reconsideration on November 1, 2017. The WCJ issued his Report on\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n9\n10\n\nNovember 3, 2017.\nIl.\nSection 3351(e) provides:\n(e) All persons incarcerated in a state penal or correctional institution while\nengaged in assigned work or employment as defined in paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (a) of Section 10021 of Title 8 of the California Code of\nRegulations, or engaged in work performed under contract. (§ 3351(e).)\nIt is undisputed here that applicant was a person incarcerated in state prison. The sole issue here\nis whether applicant was in “assigned work.”\nThe statute references Rule 10021, which was renumbered in 1998 to Rule 10133.4 without\nchange, and repealed in 2009. Former Rule 10021 provided:\n(1) “Assigned work or employment” means work performed in any pay or\nnon-pay position in a work program under the direction and with the\napproval of a duly authorized inmate leadman or supervisory leadman or\nDepartment of Corrections employee. The term does not include skill\ncenters, vocational training or academic education program (except for\nphysical fitness training and forestry training which are authorized by\nLabor Code Section 3365 as prerequisites to fire suppression duties) or\nactivities which are clearly not encompassed within the duties and\nresponsibilities of the position to which assigned. (Cal. Code Reg,, tit. 8, §\n10021 [renumbered to § 10133.4 in 1998] [repealed in 2009].)\nIn determining whether an applicant is an employee of defendant, we must look to the substance\nand essence of the relationship. (Pruitt v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 546,\n552.) Compensation in the form of wages is not necessary to find an employment relationship. (Jd. at p.\n553; Union Lbr. Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com. (1936) 12 Cal.App.2d 588, 596.) Furthermore, “the\nmandate of the liberal interpretation in favor of the workman to be given workmen's compensation\nprovisions is a material factor” to be considered. (Pruitt, supra, at p. 553.) “Liberality of interpretation\nis not only a mandate of the Legislature as the representative of the People, the People have also spoken\ndirectly in the workman's compensation constitutional provisions. [citation] ... ‘[Any] reasonable doubt\n\nas to whether an act was contemplated by the employment, in view of this state's liberal policy of\n\nDUDLEY, Glen 3\n\f \n\noo Oo YD DH HM F YW LY\n\n10\n\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\nconstruction in favor of the employee, should be resolved in favor of the employee. (Citations.)’” (/d. at\np. 553.)\n\nHere, we conclude that applicant’s volunteer work in the prison’s kitchen was the type of work\ncontemplated by the Legislature in section 3351(e). As noted above, monetary compensation is not\nnecessary to find employment. Applicant’s testimony about his work in the prison kitchen is consistent\nwith a volunteer work program at the prison. The work hours are structured and it appears that his job\nduties are supervised.\n\nAccordingly, amend the Finding of Fact to specify that applicant is an employee of defendant for\nthe relevant time period. We otherwise affirm the Finding of Fact.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons,\n\nMit\nMf\nMt\nMt\nMt\nMt\nMit\nMt\nMf\nMl\nMit\n\nDUDLEY, Glen 4\n\f \n\n1 IT IS ORDERED that applicant Glen Dudley’s Petition for Reconsideration of the Finding of\nFact issued by the workers’ compensation administrative law Judge on October 16, 2017 is AFFIRMED,\nEXCEPT that it is AMENDED as follows:\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nAugust 15, 2016 to November 21, 2016, by the State of California, Department\nof Corrections and Rehabilitation Inmate Claims.\n\naR\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 1.

We now issue our Opinion and Decision After Reconsideration,\n\nDefendant seeks reconsideration of the Joint Findings and Award and Opinion on Decision\n(F&O) issued on July 9, 2018, wherein the workers’ compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) found\nin pertinent part that defendant First Group America, First Transit, Inc. discriminated against applicant in\nviolation of Labor Code! section 132a by terminating his employment; that applicant is entitled to an\nincrease in benefits in the amount of $10,000.00; and that applicant is entitled to reinstatement and to\nrecovery of lost wages, subject to proof of wage loss, mitigation of damages, and fitness for duty, with\njurisdiction reserved by the WCAB should the parties be unable to reach agreement. The WCJ issued an\naward in favor of applicant in accordance with these findings.\n\nDefendant contends that the evidence in the record (1) is insufficient to show that defendant\nsubjected applicant to disadvantages not visited upon other employees because they were injured: (2) ;\ndemonstrates that applicant was terminated as a result of business realities; and (3) is insufficient to show\nthat applicant was able to perform his job.\n\nWe received an Answer from applicant.\n\n \n\n' Unless otherwise stated, all further statutory references are to the Labor Code.\n\flo 0D ONT DN AW BR WD YY He\n\nN NN NN Rei a ea a\nSeRPSRRBRSeSERtPReE ESRI\n\nThe WCJ filed a Report and Recommendation on Reconsideration (Report) recommending that\nthe Petition be dismissed because defendant failed to serve applicant’s counsel or denied on the merits.\n\nDefendant and applicant each filed a request for leave to file a Supplemental Petition. We\napprove the requests and accept the supplemental pleadings. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 10848.)\n\nWe have considered the allegations of the Petition, the Answer, the contents of the Report, and\nthe parties’ respective Supplemental Petitions. Based on our review of the record, and for the reasons\nstated below, we will affirm the F&O.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nWhile employed by defendant as a maintenance manager on September 22, 2011 (ADJ8898313)\nand during the period from June 20, 1998 through September 22, 2011 (ADJ10299691), applicant\nsustained specific and cumulative injuries to his bilateral knees.\n\nOn May 30, 2018, the matter proceeded to trial as to applicant’s 132a petition. (Minutes of\nHearing and Summary of Evidence, May 30, 2018, p. 2:22-24.)\n\nThe WCJ admitted the April 13, 2015 and May 11, 2015 reports of applicant’s treating physician,\nDr. Koch, into evidence. (Ex. 9, Report of Dr. Koch, April 13, 2015; Ex. 8, Report of Dr. Koch, May 11,\n2015.) The WCJ also admitted Dr. Koch’s return to work slip dated June 25, 2015, into evidence. (Ex.\n7, Return to Work Slip, June 25, 2015.)\n\nDr. Koch’s April 13, 2015 report is addressed to Gallagher Bassett as defendant’s adjuster. (Ex.\n9, Report of Dr. Koch, April 13, 2015, p. 1.) It states as follows:\n\nEMP:FIRST TRANSIT REDWOOD\n\nDOI:09/22/2011\n\nBODY PART: B/L KNEES.\n\nINDUSTRIAL REPORT\n\nEMERSON, GARY\n\nMr. Emerson is scheduled for left total knee arthroplasty.\n\n(Id)\n\nEMERSON, Gary 2\n\foO OU UNO BROW ti\n\nNN NN Ne ea ea ea ea a\nFF Vw Nn = OD 0D DOD DY DH HW BR WY BH LG\n\n25\n\nDr. Koch’s May 11, 2015 report is also addressed to Gallagher Basset as defendant’s adjuster and\nrefers to applicant’s September 22, 2011 injury to the bilateral knees. (Ex. 8, Report of Dr. Koch, May\n11, 2015, p. 1.) It states as follows:\n\nPost left total knee arthroplasty.\n\nHe states he is very happy with his progress in therapy and is having very\n\nlittle pain.\n\n(Id.)\n\nDr. Koch’s retum to work slip does not disclose to whom, if anyone, it was directed, but states\nthat applicant “can return to work [on] 8/8/15.” (Ex. 7, Return to Work Slip, June 25, 2015.)\n\nThe WCJ also admitted letters from applicant’s supervisor, Jodi McNamer, to applicant dated\nJune 23, 2015 and July 3, 2015, into evidence. (Ex. X, Correspondence to Mr. Emerson, June 23, 2015;\nEx.

Since that\n\ntime, you have not provided any documentation that indicates that you are currently under\n\nthe care of a physician and are unable to work.\n\nAt this, since I have not received any written documentation from your treating physician\n\nthat indicates that you are unable to perform your duties as a Mechanic, and since you do\n\nnot meet the criteria for FMLA, it has been determined that you have voluntarily resigned\n\nyour position.\n\nIf you have questions or believe that the above is not accurate, please contact me to\n\ndiscuss no later than five days from your receipt of this letter. In the event that you do not\n\ncontact me it will be determined that you agree and final paperwork will be processed.\n\n(Ex. X, Correspondence to Mr. Emerson, June 23, 2015.)\n\nDefendant’s July 3, 2015 letter to applicant states:\n\nOn June 29, . . . you advised that you would be bringing a note from your treating\n\nphysician that substantiates your absence which began on April 29, 2015... [YJou have\n\nfailed to provide this information and have failed to contact me at all.\n\nTherefore, it has been determined that you are unable to provide this information and that\n\nyou have voluntarily resigned your position.\n\n(Ex. A, Correspondence to Applicant, July 3, 2015.)\n\nDefendant identified and marked portions of its employee handbook as exhibit B, but the WC]\n\n26 || declined to admit the exhibit into evidence. (Minutes of Hearing and Summary of Evidence, May 30,\n\n27|| 2018, pp. 5:16, 6:8.)\n\nEMERSON, Gary 3\n\n \n\fApplicant proffered the deposition transcript of Jodi McNamer for purposes of impeachment and\nthe WCI admitted the transcript into evidence. (Id., p. 5:4-10.)\n\nAt trial, applicant testified that he began working for defendant in June 1998 and that defendant\nterminated him on July 3, 2015. (Minutes of Hearing and Summary of Evidence, May 30, 2018, p. 7:7-\n8.) He injured his right knee in June 2011, and underwent surgery on the knee in 2012 and again in\nOctober 2012. (/d., p. 7:11-12.) In February 2014 he was asked by his supervisor, Jodi McNamer, to\nreturn to work early because defendant did not have anyone to do his job. Ud., pp. 7:12-13, 8:15.) He\nreturned to work and injured his left knee by favoring his right knee, which was not fully healed. (/d., p.\n7:13-14.)\n\nIn April 2015, he underwent surgery on the left knee. When he went off work for the surgery, his\nsupervisor in Redding, Kathy Cravens, called him three times and told him he would be abandoning his\njob if he went forward with the surgery. (/d., p. 7:18.)\n\nAfter his surgery, he received a termination letter from Ms. McNamer, asserting that he had failed\nto give her any information when he went off work. (/d., p. 7:20.) He had provided the requested\ninformation, and his physician, Dr. Koch, had sent reports to defendant. (Jd., p. 7:21-22.) He telephoned\nMs. McNamer and left her messages regarding the letter, but she never returned his calls; and, when he\nwent to the office to speak with her, the dispatcher advised that she would call him but she never did.\nUd., p. 7:23-25.)\n\nMs. McNamer testified at trial that she concluded that applicant had voluntarily resigned because\nshe did not receive any medical documentation from him and was not informed about a work-related\ninjury. (/d., p. 11:18-19.) She further testified, however, that her recollection regarding whether or when\nshe had been informed that applicant was to undergo left knee surgery for a work injury was not as good\nas it had been at the time of her deposition. (Transcript of Proceedings, May 30, 2018, p. 97:22-100:10.)\nIn deposition, she testified that she had been informed by defendant’s workers’ compensation adjuster\nthat applicant was to undergo left-knee surgery in April 2015 and that the surgery related to a claimed\nwork injury. (Ex. 18, Deposition Transcript of Jodi McNamer, pp. 30:12-31:12.)\n\nIn her Report, the WCJ states:\n\nEMERSON, Gary 4\n\f \n\noO ON DH BR WwW BB we\n\nNN NN ae a ea a a\n\nIn April of 2015, [applicant] told Jodi McNamer he was going to have a left total knee\nreplacement. He told her it was related to his work. She did not give him a claim form...\n\nOf particular interest in deciding this case was Ms. McNamer’s testimony she went off\n\nwork when her husband had a heart attack on June 15, 2015. When she returned to work\n\nafter his heart attack there was a release for [applicant] to return to work signed by Dr.\n\nKoch. It as in a “pile of stuff that I had when I got back, when I returned to work.”\n\n(Transcript p. 94) (Minutes of Hearing and Summary of Evidence May 30, 2018, p. 12\n\nlines 11-18)\n\nIn summary the employer knew or should have known the left knee surgery was claimed\n\nas an industrial injury, failed to respond to two telephone inquiries and one in person visit\n\nfrom [applicant] and had a doctor’s note that arrived at some unspecified time before\n\n[applicant] was terminated . . .\n\n[T]he employer failed to follow up with the adjusting agency or the applicant. Nor did\n\nthe employer sort through the documents on Ms. McNamer’s desk while she was out to\n\nget the medical information required,\n\nNor was there a sufficient showing the termination was a business necessity . . .\n\nReinstatement was ordered subject to a fitness for duty evaluation regarding whether Mr.\n\nEmerson could return to his duties. Jurisdiction was reserved as to the reinstatement\n\nissue as well as whether sufficient mitigation efforts were made and how much wage had\n\nactually been lost. There is no final decision as to those issues pending further\n\ninformation.\n\n(Report, pp. 3-6.)\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPreliminarily, we address the issues raised by the parties’ Supplemental Petitions regarding\ndefendant’s failure to serve the Petition upon applicant’s counsel. Here, WCAB Rule 10510(a)(2)\nrequires that service by a party be made on the attorney for the injured party. However, notwithstanding\ndefendant’s failure to serve applicant’s counsel, applicant's counsel learned of the filing of the Petition\nand notified defendant’s counsel of the failure of service. Thereafter, defendant’s counsel promptly\nsought to rectify the failure by emailing a copy of the Petition to applicant’s counsel and filing an\namended proof of service. As a result, applicant’s counsel was able to timely file the Answer. We\ntherefore conclude that applicant sustained no prejudice as a result of defendant’s failure to serve the\nPetition upon his counsel. Accordingly, we decline to dismiss the Petition.\n\nUnder section 132a, “[i]t is the declared policy of this state that there should not be discrimination\nagainst workers who are injured in the course and scope of their employment.” Section 132a protects an\n\nemployee from retaliation or discrimination by an employer because of an exercise of workers’\n\nEMERSON, Gary 5\n\fSCS Oo mem NY DW BR WwW PB Ke\n\nNN NY NY NN a a a eg\nSSBRBBRBREBR SRE BRFRZBEBDSE I\n\ncompensation rights.

(1993) 20\nCal.App.4th 1520, 1526 [58 Cal.Comp.Cases 813].)\n\nSection 132a states as relevant:\n\nAny employer who discharges, or threatens to discharge, or in any manner discriminates\n\nagainst any employee because he or she has filed or made known his or her intention to\n\nfile a claim...or an application for adjudication, or because the employee has received a\n\nrating, award, or settlement...testified or made known his or her intention to testify in\n\nanother employee’s case... may be guilty of a misdemeanor and responsible for the\n\npayment of increased compensation, costs, lost wages and work benefits to the injured\nemployee.\n\nThis section has been “interpreted liberally to achieve the goal of preventing discrimination\nagainst workers injured on the job,” while not compelling an employer to “ignore the realities of doing\nbusiness by ‘reemploying’ unqualified employees or employees for whom positions are no longer\navailable.” (Lauher, supra, 30 Cal.4th at pp. 1298-1299 [citations omitted].)\n\nIn Lauher, the Supreme Court clarified its definition of “discrimination,” noting that in its\nprevious decisions in Smith, supra and Barns v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d\n524, the Court held that an employer’s action which caused detriment to the employee because of an\nindustrial injury was sufficient to show a violation of the statute. (Lauher, supra, 30 Cal.4th at p. 1299\nquoting [1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers’ Compensation (rev. 2d ed., Peterson et\nal. edits, 2002)], § 10.11[1], p. 10-20 [“[t}he critical question is whether the employer's action caused\ndetriment to an industrially injured employee”); see Barns, supra, 216 Cal.App.3d at p. 531.)\n\nThe Lauher court noted with approval the Court of Appeal’s finding that the formulation\nenunciated in Smith v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. ( 1984) 152 Cal.App.3rd 1104, and adopted by\nBarns to establish a prima facie case was “analytically incomplete”:\n\nThe court explained that, although Lauher had clearly suffered a detriment by having to\n\nuse his accumulated sick leave and vacation time for his visits to see Dr. Houts, he never\n\nestablished he ‘had a legal right to receive TDI [temporary disability indemnity] and\n\nretain his accrued sick leave and vacation time, and that [his employer] had a\nEMERSON, Gary 6\n\f \n\ncorresponding legal duty to pay TDI and refrain from docking the sick leave and vacation\n\ntime.’ Thus, said the court, ‘[t]o meet the burden of presenting a prima facie claim of\n\nunlawful discrimination in violation of section 132a, it is insufficient that the industrially\n\ninjured worker show only that... he or she suffered some adverse result as a\n\nconsequence of some action or inaction by the employer that was triggered by the\n\nindustrial injury. The claimant must also show that he or she had a legal right to receive\n\nor retain the deprived benefit or status, and the employer had a corresponding legal duty\n\nto provide or refrain from taking away that benefit or status.’ ” (Lauher, supra, 30\n\nCal.4th at pp. 1299-1300, italics added.)\n\nThe Court further agreed with the Court of Appeal that “[an] employer thus does not necessarily\nengage in ‘discrimination’ prohibited by section 132a merely because it requires an employee to shoulder\nsome of the disadvantages of his industrial injury. By prohibiting ‘discrimination’ in section 132a, we\nassume that the Legislature meant to prohibit treating injured employees differently, making them subject\nto disadvantages not visited on other employees because the employee was injured or had made a claim.”\n(Lauher, supra at p. 1300.)\n\nAs the Lauher court determined in the first part of its decision, the employee was no longer\nentitled to temporary disability indemnity (TDI) because his condition was permanent and stationary.\n(Lauher, supra at p. 1297.) Therefore, even though the employee’s use of sick and vacation leave was\nfor medical treatment and time off due to his industrial disability, because he was not entitled to TDI, the\nemployee was treated in the same way as non-industrially disabled workers who were also required to\nuse sick and vacation leave for medical treatment and time off due to a disability. Because the employee\nin Lauher was in the same position as non-industrially injured employees with respect to this issue, he\ncould not show a legal right to TDI, and therefore could have only established a prima facie case for\ndiscrimination if he had been “singled out for disadvantageous treatment.” (Ud. at p. 1301; Accord,\nGelson's Markets, Inc. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2009), 74 Cal.Comp.Cases 1313, County of San\nLuis Obispo v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd.

Stated another way, an employee must show they were\nsubject to “disadvantages not visited on other employees because they were injured... .” (id? Because\nthe employee in Lauher was not deprived of a legal right to TDI, and therefore could not show he was\ntreated differently than other employees with respect to his alleged detriment, he could not establish a\nprima facie case of discrimination.3\n\nIn this regard, we agree with the reasoning of the WCI, as expressed in the Report, that the\nevidence demonstrates that defendant singled applicant out for disadvantageous treatment by terminating\nhis employment on the false ground that he resigned from his job. (Report, p. 5.) Specifically,\ndefendant’s June 23, 2015 and July 3, 2015 letters assert that applicant “voluntarily resigned” his position\nbased upon his failure to provide documentation that he was under the care of a physician and unable to\nwork. (Ex. X, Correspondence to Mr. Emerson, June 23, 2015; Ex. A, Correspondence to Applicant, July\n3, 2015.) However, the evidence before us demonstrates that at the time defendant terminated applicant\nit had been informed that applicant would be off work to undergo surgery for a claimed work injury and\nthat he was medically restricted from work until at least August 8, 2015.\n\nHere, applicant testified that he had provided defendant the information requested regarding his\n\nsurgery, Ms. McNamer testified in deposition that the adjuster advised her that applicant would undergo\n\n \n\n? Accord, St. John Knits v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. 2019 Cal. Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 75 [writ den.; the Court of\nAppeals found no reasonable grounds to review a WCAB finding of section 132a discrimination based upon\nsubstantial evidence of defendant employer’s subjection of industrially-injured employee to disadvantages not\nvisited on other employees.]\n\n3 We also note that the articular standard denoted by the phrase “singled out” does not literally apply where the\n#. PI\n\ndetriment affects injured workers as a class, although the broader standard would apply. (Anderson, Supra at pp.\n1377-1378.)\n\nEMERSON, Gary 8\n\n \n\f \n\noC ODO DOD NY DN HW BR WD BH w\n\nNY NY NN N NN Be He He He ee Oe Re DY\nSS S&P BSRRSSERUREEBSEC\n\nleft knee surgery for a claimed work injury, applicant’s treating physician sent reports to defendant’s\nadjuster advising of applicant’s medical status with reference to his September 22, 2015 injury claim,\nand Ms. McNamer testified at trial that applicant’s release to return to work on August 8, 2015, was ina\n“pile of stuff that I had when I got back, when I returned to work.” (Minutes of Hearing and Summary of\nEvidence, May 30, 2018, p. 7:18-22; Ex. 18, Deposition Transcript of Jodi McNamer, pp. 30:12-31:12;\nEx. 9, Report of Dr. Koch, April 13, 2015; Ex. 8, Report of Dr. Koch, May 11, 2015; Report, pp. 4-5;\nEx. 7, Return to Work Slip, June 25, 2015.) We therefore concur with the reasoning of the WCJ, as\nexpressed in the Report, that defendant terminated applicant even though it knew or should have known\nthat he was off work for surgery to his left knee for a claimed work injury. (Report, p. 5.)\n\nAccordingly, we will affirm the WCJ’s finding that the evidence in the record is sufficient to\nestablish applicant’s prima facie case of section 132a discrimination. ‘\n\nNevertheless, when an employee establishes a prima facie case, the defendant still retains the right\nto present evidence to rebut applicant’s prima facie case. (See § 5705; Judson, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p.\n667.) In rebuttal, the employer must show that its actions were \"necessitated by ‘the realities of doing\nbusiness.’” (Judson, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 667; Smith, supra, 152 Cal.App.3d at p. 110.) The employer’s\nstated business reasons must be reasonable under the facts of the case. (Barns, supra, 216 Cal.App.3d at\np. 534-535.) Thus, evidence produced by an employee in the prima facie case, and the related inferences\nraised by such evidence, may support a finding of retaliation or discrimination if the reason offered by\nthe employer is unreasonable or not credible under the totality of the circumstances of an individual case.\n(See Westendorf v. W. Coast Contrs. of Nev., Inc. (9th Cir. 2013) 712 F.3d 417, 423. (Citation omitted).)\nWe note also that while an employer’s motivation might be discriminatory in its effect, section 132a does\nnot require proof of discriminatory intent. (Lauher, supra at p. 1301, fn. 8, italics added.)\n\nHere, defendant’s stated reason for terminating applicant was that he failed to provide\ndocumentation regarding the medical reasons for his absences. (Ex. X, Correspondence to Mr. Emerson,\nJune 23, 2015; Ex. A, Correspondence to Applicant, July 3, 2015.) However, as we have explained,\ndefendant presented insufficient evidence to demonstrate that it lacked notice that applicant had\n\nundergone surgery for a claimed industrial injury and been medically restricted from work thereafter.\n\nEMERSON, Gary 9\n\n \n\f_\n\no © NY DH UW FBR W WY\n\n10\n\nFurthermore, defendant’s contention that certain provisions of its employment manual provide grounds\nfor applicant’s termination lacks evidentiary support inasmuch as the employment manual was not\nadmitted into evidence and defendant does not allege that the WCIJ erred by failing to admit the manual.\n(Petition, p. 10:11; Minutes of Hearing and Summary of Evidence, May 30, 2018, pp. 5:16, 6:8.) We\ntherefore agree with the decision of the WCIJ, as expressed in the Report, that defendant failed to\nestablish a legitimate business reason for applicant’s termination. (Report, p. 5.) Accordingly, we will\naffirm the WCIJ’s finding that defendant discriminated against applicant in violation of section 132a.\nTurning to defendant’s contention that applicant failed to demonstrate that he is medically able to\nreturn to work, we concur with the opinion of the WC] , as expressed in the Report, that because the order\nof reinstatement is explicitly subject to a fitness for duty evaluation with jurisdiction reserved to the\nWCAB, there has been no final decision issued regarding the issue of reinstatement and, in consequence,\nwe are unable to discern grounds for reconsideration of the issue.

This is our\nDecision After Reconsideration.\n\nIn the Findings and Award of January 3, 2019 in ADJ10335071, the workers’ compensation\njudge (WC)J) found that during the period June 1, 1983 to August 21, 2015, applicant sustained industrial\ninjury to his ears (hearing), right wrist, left elbow, hips, knees, headaches, psyche, and lower back,\ncausing permanent disability of 77%. The WCJ also found that the medical evidence justifies a\ncombined rather than added permanent disability rating, and that applicant’s attorney is entitled to an\nattorney’s fee based upon 15% of the value of permanent disability indemnity, exclusive of the value of\napplicant’s life pension.\n\nApplicant’s attorney filed a timely petition for reconsideration of the WCIJ’s decision in\nADJ10335071.! In the petition, it is contended that the WCJ erred in rejecting the medical opinion of Dr.\nStephane Johnson, Panel Qualified Medical Evaluator (PQME) in psychiatry, that applicant’s permanent\nimpairments should be added rather than combined, and that in determining and calculating the\n\nattorney’s fee, the WCJ erred in excluding the value of the life pension.\n\n! No party sought reconsideration of the Findings and Award in ADJ 10335087, wherein the WCI found\nthat on May 14, 2014, applicant sustained industrial injury to his neck vertebrae, facial bones, soft tissue,\nhead and teeth, causing in permanent disability of 46%. Because there is no objection to the Findings\nand Award in ADJ10335087, we will affirm it. (Lab. Code, § 5904.)\n\foOo ea IN DW BF WD LP\n\n10\n11\n\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\nDefendant filed an answer.\nThe WCJ submitted a Report and Recommendation (“Report”). We adopt and incorporate only\nthe statement of facts set forth in the Report, as follows:\n\nFor case ADJ10335071, the parties had narrowed the issue to whether or\nnot the permanent disability of the medical providers should be combined\nor added. That is, the parties stipulated that the base permanent disability\nfrom Andrew Berman, M.D., the ENT agreed medical evaluator (“AME”)\nand David Wood, M.D., the orthopedic AME was 73%. The parties had\nfurther agreed that Stephane Johnson, M.D., the psyche qualified medical\nevaluator (“QME”), issued a report with a 15% permanent disability for\npsyche. (MOH/SOE Trial 11/6/18, pg. 3:5-6.)\n\nThe parties disputed whether or not the 15% permanent disability for\npsyche provided by Dr. Johnson should be added for a total PD of 88% or\ncombined using the combined values chart (“CVC”) for a total PD of\n77%. The parties stipulated that this cumulative trauma rated either at a\n77% or an 88% final permanent disability. The issue was whether or not\nthere was substantial medical evidence to rebut the CVC based on\nStephane Johnson’s assessment to allow the addition method of the 15%\npermanent disability.\n\nOn January 3, 2019, this WCALJ found, inter alia, the CVC was not\nrebutted and applicant was entitled to a combined permanent partial\ndisability award of 77%. The medical opinions were neither persuasive\nnor substantial medical evidence to support a rebuttal of the combined\nvalues chart rating method. Applicant’s attorney was also entitled to\nreasonable attorney’s fees of 15% of permanent disability.\n\nBased on our review of the record and applicable law, and for the reasons discussed below, we\nconclude that the issue of whether applicant’s permanent disabilities should be combined or added\nrequires further development of the medical record. In addition, we conclude that the WCJ must revisit\nthe issue of attorney’s fees. Therefore, we will rescind the WCJ’s decision in ADJ10335071 and return\nthis matter to the trial level for further proceedings and new decision by the WCJ.\n\nRegarding the issue of adding versus combining permanent impairments, the panel of the Appeals\nBoard in Athens Administrators v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (Kite) (2013) 78 Cal.Comp.Cases 213\n\n(writ den.) adopted the WCJ’s approach of adding permanent disabilities rather than combining them\n\nGONZALES, Richard 2\n\funder the Combined Values Chart (“CVC”);? the basis for addition rather than combination of the\ndisabilities was “the synergistic effect of one hip injury upon another opposite hip injury.” Specifically,\nthe Board panel adopted the following analysis provided by the WCI:\n\nTurning to Dr. Cheng’s determination that simple addition of applicant’s\nleft and right hip impairments provided a more accurate depiction of his\noverall impairment than application of the reduction formula, the WCJ\nstated in relevant part:\n\nDr. Cheng points to the synergistic effect of one hip injury upon another\nopposite hip injury. I agree. It appears logical that a person who is able to\ncompensate through the opposite member for an injury to one limb is to\nsome extent less disabled or impaired than someone who cannot so\ncompensate.\n\nI remain persuaded that the QME has appropriately determined that the\nimpairment resulting from applicant’s left and right hip injuries is most\naccurately combined using simple addition than by use of the combined-\nvalues formula.\n\nIn Taina v. County of Santa Clara/Valley Medical Center (2018) 2018 Cal. Wrk. Comp. P.D.\nLEXIS 344, the panel of the Appeals Board further explained, “disability values of multiple impairments\nmay be added instead of combined using the CVC if that provides an accurate rating, particularly when\nthere is no overlap, and when the synergistic effect of the multiple disabilities support that method of\ncombination.” (Slip opinion, at pp. 10-11.) Of course, the opinion of an evaluating physician who finds\na synergistic effect between injuries or disabilities, so as to justify addition rather than combination to\nmost accurately rate permanent disability, must comply with the usual requirements of substantial\nevidence. (Blackledge v. Bank of America (2010) 75 Cal.Comp.Cases 613, 620-621 [Appeals Board en\nbanc].)\n\nAs stated by the panel of the Appeals Board in De La Cerda v. Martin Selko & Co. (2017) 83\n\nCal.Comp.Cases 567 (writ den.), the fact that an AME does “not use the term ‘synergistic’ to advocate\n\n2 The Combined Values Chart is found at pages 8-1 through 8-4 of the 2005 Schedule for Rating\nPermanent Disabilities (“PDRS”).\n\nGONZALES, Richard 3\n\n \n\folNUOOUlUlUMDWUNSN UDO BOND\n\n_\n\n12\n\nfor the use of the additive rating method is not determinative of the validity of using that method. The\nimpairments may be added if substantial medical evidence supports the physician’s opinion that adding\nthem will result in a more accurate rating of the applicant’s level of disability than the rating resulting\nfrom the use of the CVC.” (Italics added.)\n\nIn this case, to the extent the WCJ’s determination of permanent disability is based upon the need\nfor a “synergistic effect” between impairments as an absolute precondition to adding rather than\ncombining impairments to rate the permanent disability, we disagree. Rather, as discussed in De La\nCerda, impairments may be added if substantial medical evidence supports the physician's opinion that\nadding them will result in a more accurate rating of the injured employee’s overall permanent disability.\nFurthermore, the AMA Guides themselves explain that in appropriate cases, Whole Person Impairments\nmay be added or a multiplier may be used, as opposed to combining impairments. (See American\nMedical Association (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (5th ed.), Chapter 1.4,\npp. 9-10.)\n\nIn this case, Dr. Johnson gave applicant a Global Assessment Functioning (GAF) score of 63,\ntranslating to Whole Person Impairment of 11%. (Joint Exhibit 10, Johnson report dated July 28, 2017.)\nIn a final narrative report dated November 6, 2017, Dr. Johnson’s opinion on applicant’s psychiatric\npermanent impairment did not change. (Joint Exhibit 11.) Although neither report addressed the issue of\nwhich method — combining or adding impairments - would result in the most accurate rating, the issue\nwas partially addressed in Dr. Johnson’s deposition of October 26, 2018.3 (Joint Exhibit 16.) At pages\n\n15-24, Dr. Johnson testified, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nQ. Are you familiar with the combined values?\nA. Yeah. Combine -- added versus combined.\nQ. Yeah. Now, I want to ask you: Is there interaction between the\n\nmastication, the hearing loss, the lumbar spine, the right knee, and the left\nknee injuries, and the psychiatric disability that you have given? Is there\ninteraction? Is there overlap between the other disabilities and the\npsychiatric disability?\n\n3 We admonish applicant’s attorney for his unprofessional and disruptive behavior during the deposition,\nas reflected in the testimony recorded at pp. 18-20 and pp. 23-24 of the deposition.\n\nGONZALES, Richard 4\n\foOo ON DH MH FR WY HH eS\n\nNNN NNN Be ee Be ee ee oe\nSeaeseB BBPRBSGSeSe ARSE ESH IS\n\nA. So I’m going to -- let me make sure I understand your question.\nSo you’re asking me about a set of physical and organ-based injuries, and\nyou’re asking if the impairment caused by each has any overlap to the\nassociated psychiatric impairment?\n\nQ. Yes. The direct psychiatric impairment from the stress, from the\nPTSD. Is there overlap? Because I know that you’ve given compensable\nconsequence disability. I’m not asking you about that disability.\n\nA. Yeah, so the answer is no, there is no overlap because the physical\ninjuries caused orthopedic impairment, primarily orthopedic impairment\nwhile the direct psychiatric injury caused symptoms of posttraumatic\nstress disorder, which are not caused by any of the physical injuries --\n\nQ. Okay. Ill stop you there.\nA. Okay.\n\nQ. Your understanding of the combined values schedule, you\nunderstand that when, for example, you have impairment of 78 and you’re\ncombining in another 15 percent, that you reduce that 15 percent by a\nfactor of 78 percent, so that 15 becomes a four, and then is added to the\n78. So a 78 combined with 15 is going to be 82. Do you understand that\nconcept?\n\nA. I don’t -- I’m not familiar with the math, but I understand the\nconcept of synergy versus the combined, as described --\n\nQ. Well, I’m not talking about synergistic. I know that that’s the Kite\ncase.\n\nA. Yeah.\n\nQ. And I know that you probably have an understanding of the Kite\ncase and the synergistic effect being more than the sum of the totals, and\ntherefore, the Kite case allowing an addition.\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. There is also case law that says when you have completely and\ntotally separate permanent disability, you have separate disabilities --\n\nA. Okay.\nQ. -- and a physician finds that it is more appropriate to add those\n\ndisabilities rather than combine them and reduce the disabilities by a\nfactor of each other --\n\nGONZALES, Richard 5\n\f \n\noO Oo NI DH BB WwW WV\n\n10\n11\n\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\nOkay.\n-- that that may be used to rebut the combined values --\nOkay.\n\n-- schedule.\n\nPrP Oo > DB >\n\nOkay.\n\n. So my question to you is: In this case, looking at the specific\ndisability being assigned by yourself and what I’m representing to you\nbeing assigned by other specialties and other physicians, does this case\nreach a more fair result with adding those disabilities or combining those\ndisabilities?\n\nA. In -- I’m sorry. In adding them.\n\nQ. In adding them?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Can you explain that, given your understanding of this, and give\nme a little bit of a narrative and support yourself medicolegally so that a\n\nworkers’ compensation judge may gain some insight into your thought\nprocess?\n\nTHE WITNESS: So the direct -- the psychiatric impairment that has\nbeen deemed direct and associated with the trauma of his work, it should\nbe added to the rest of the impairment that has been given by other\nspecialties. And the justification for that is that the impairment, the\npsychiatric impairment has no overlap with the orthopedic, the auditory, or\nI think...\n\nBY MR. BREWSAUGH:\nIt’s mastication --\nMastication --\n\n-- hearing loss --\n\n> 2 PO\n\n-- dental, hearing loss, and so on.\n\nQ. Lumbar, right knee, left knee.\n\nGONZALES, Richard 6\n\f27\n\nA. All right. They all have very specific impairment direction that\ninclude, for example, avoiding lifting, avoiding standing up for a certain\nperiod of time, avoiding chewing certain foods and perhaps, you know,\npreserving one’s hearing in whatever ways, while the psychiatric\nimpairment is different. It impairs areas of socialization, adaptation to\nstressors and changes, ability to maintain pace and concentration and\nfocus during basic activities. It causes --\n\nTHE WITNESS: So I was saying that, yeah, the impairment caused\nby PTSD symptoms are -- have nothing to do with impairment caused by\nspecific injuries to the body as described by the specialist in this specific\nNCDOI.\n\nSo the impairment -- psychiatric impairment should be added to the other\nimpairment.\n\nAlthough Dr. Johnson’s deposition testimony establishes that there is no overlap between the\nphysical and mental impairments, his agreement under questioning by applicant’s attorney that “this case\nreach[es] a more fair result with adding those disabilities” is not the equivalent of a medically-supported\nopinion that adding disabilities will result in a more accurate rating, as required by case law. Yet, as the\nCourt of Appeal stated in Telles Transport, Inc. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th\n1159, 1164 [66 Cal.Comp.Cases 1290], “the WCJ or the Board may not leave undeveloped matters\nwhich its acquired specialized knowledge should identify as requiring further evidence.” Here, since Dr.\nJohnson has opined that there is no overlap between the physical and mental impairments, and this\nsuggests that adding the impairments may result in a more accurate rating, the medical record must be\ndeveloped with a supplemental report or additional testimony from Dr. Johnson. (McDuffie v. Los\nAngeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (2002) 67 Cal.Comp.Cases 138 [Appeals Board en\nbanc].) Therefore, we will rescind the WCJ’s decision and return this matter to him for further\nproceedings and new decision.\n\nTurning to the issue of attorney’s fees, we agree with the WCJ that the fee must be reasonable,\n\nand that determining the amount of the fee is within the discretion of the WCAB, considering (1) the\n\nresponsibility assumed by the attorney; (2) the care exercised in representing the applicant; (3) the time\n\nGONZALES, Richard 7\n\n \n\f—\n\noO Oo DTN DH HH F YW NY\n\ninvolved; and (4) the results obtained. (Lab. Code, § 4906(d); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 10844.)\n\nIn this case, we also agree with the WCJ that in consideration of the above factors, as well as the\ncomplexity of this matter, it appears that 15% of the value of permanent disability benefits is reasonable.\nApplicant’s attorney participated in two depositions and authored a trial brief, and there was extensive\ndirect examination of applicant at trial. Further, this case is above average in complexity, in that it:\ninvolved production of multiple reports in several different medical specialties.\n\nHowever, we disagree with the WCJ that in determining a reasonable fee, no consideration should\nbe given to the value of the life pension, a benefit obtained in part through applicant’s attorney’s efforts.\nWe are persuaded that the attorney’s fee should be calculated based on the life pension award, not just\nthe value of the permanent partial disability indemnity. Further, this calculation will include accounting\nfor the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) and State Average Weekly Wage (SAWW) pursuant to\nLabor Code section 4659(c). (See 2 Cal. Workers’ Comp. Practice (Cont. Ed. Bar, March 2019 Update)\nLien Claims, § 15.2; Gilmore v. Autoland Resale Ctr. (2013) 2013 Cal. Wrk. Comp. P.D. LEXIS 148;\nWilson v. Piedmont Lumber & Nursery (2012) 2012 Cal. Wrk. Comp. P.D. LEXIS 48.)\n\nFinally, we note that in requesting an increased attorney’s fee, applicant’s attorney failed to\n\ncomply with WCAB Rule 10842. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 10842.) The rule states as follows:\n\n“All requests for an increase in attorney’s fee shall be accompanied by proof of service on the\napplicant of written notice of the attorney’s adverse interest and of the applicant’s right to seek\nindependent counsel. Failure to notify the applicant may constitute grounds for dismissal of the request\nfor increase in fee.”\n\nWe admonish applicant’s attorney for his failure to comply with the rule; he should take care to\ndo so in all future proceedings of this nature. Nevertheless, we note that because this opinion\nincorporates the text of the rule and this opinion will be served on the applicant herein, he is hereby\nnotified of his attorney’s adverse interest and of his right to seek independent counsel regarding his\nattorney’s request for an increased fee.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons,\n\nGONZALES, Richard 8\n\f \n\n23\n24\n2\n26\n27\n\nws\n\n \n\nIT IS ORDERED, as the Decision After Reconsideration of the Workers’ Compensation\nAppeals Board, that the Findings and Award of January 3, 2019 in ADJ10335087 is AFFIRMED.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, as the Decision After Reconsideration of the Workers’\nCompensation Appeals Board, that the Findings and Award of January 3, 2019 in ADJ10335071 is\nRESCINDED, and this matter is RETURNED to the trial level for further proceedings and new\ndecision by the WCJ in ADJ10335071, consistent with this opinion.\n\nWORKERS’ COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD\n\nI CONCUR,\n\n\\\n\na\n\n  \n\nTHERINE ZALEWSK}\n\nDATED AND FILED AT SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA\n\nJAN 0 3 2020\n\nSERVICE MADE ON THE ABOVE DATE ON THE PERSONS LISTED BELOW AT THEIR\nADDRESSES SHOWN ON THE CURRENT OFFICIAL ADDRESS RECORD.\n\nRICHARD GONZALES\nSTATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND (2)\nWHITING & COTTER LLP\n\nJTL/bea\n\nGONZALES, Richard 9\n\f",

This is our\nDecision After Reconsideration.\n\nApplicant, Antonio Hernandez, seeks reconsideration of the Findings and Award issued by the\nworkers’ compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) on May 18, 2018. In that decision, the WCJ\nfound that applicant sustained industrial injury to his cervical spine, lumbar spine, and right shoulder on\nJune 21, 2013, while employed as a loader/unloader by TS Staffing Services. In relevant part, the WCJ\nfurther found that applicant’s injury caused 24% permanent disability after apportionment of 60% of\napplicant’s cervical spine disability and 80% of applicant’s lumbar spine disability pursuant to Labor\nCode section 4663.!\n\nApplicant’s petition for reconsideration contends that the WCJ incorrectly applied section 4663\napportionment instead of section 4664(b) and incorrectly applied a “substantial medical evidence”\n\nprerequisite to application of section 4664(b) apportionment because only proof of the existence of the\n\n!

Based on our review of the record and for the reasons stated in the WCI’s\nReport, which we adopt and incorporate herein, we affirm the WCJ’s May 18, 2018 decision.\n\nAs discussed in the WCJ’s Report, on January 4, 2010, a Stipulated Findings and Award issued in\nCase No. ADJ2978577, which found that applicant sustained a July 1, 2008 injury to his cervical spine,\nlumbar spine, and right knee while employed by Mainstay Business Solutions resulting in 33%\npermanent disability. (Joint Exhibit XX.) As the WCJ’s Report observes, the stipulated award is silent\nregarding what medical evidence formed the basis for the 33% permanent disability finding.\n\nAt the March 20, 2018 trial in the present case (Case No. ADJ9020574), the parties submitted in\nevidence the October 12, 2015 report (Joint Exhibit WW) and the November 3, 2016 deposition\ntranscript (Joint Exhibit XX) of Laura Wertheimer Hatch, M.D., the agreed medical evaluator (AME) in\northopedics. They also submitted in evidence the August 9, 2009 report of Kambiz Hannani, M.D. (Joint\nExhibit YY), who was the panel qualified medical evaluator (PQME) in connection with applicant’s prior\ninjury of July 1, 2008\n\nIn her Report, the WCJ discussed Dr. Hatch’s October 12, 2015 report and November 3, 2016\ndeposition opinions, together with the legal principles regarding apportionment, as follows:\n\nIf an employee has received a prior award of permanent disability, it will be\nconclusively presumed that the prior permanent disability exists at the time of a\nsubsequent industrial injury. This presumption affects the burden of proof. Lab.C.\n4664(b); Kopping v. Work. Comp. App. Bd. (2006) 142 C.A.4th 1099, 1114, 48\nC.R.3d 618, 71 Cal.Comp.Cases 1229. In the present case, Dr. Hatch concluded that\nthe Applicant sustained industrial injuries to the cervical spine, lumbar spine and right\nshoulder. She opined that there was disability of twenty per cent (20%) WPI to the\ncervical spine, twenty-seven per cent (27%) WPI to the lumbar spine, and zero per\ncent (0%) WPI to the right shoulder. The resulting combined orthopedic disability\nwas forty-two per cent (42%) before apportionment.\n\nHERNANDEZ, Antonio 2\n\f \n\nhee\n\noO Oo YN DH WH FR W LH\n\nDr. Hatch was provided with a copy of the 33% Award on the earlier July 1, 2008\ninjury and it was specifically considered in her assessment of disability and\napportionment. She apportioned fifty per cent (50%) of applicant’s lumbar disability\nto moderate to severe degenerative changes based on MRI studies, 30% due to\nprevious low back injuries and 20% due to the June 21, 2013 injury. For the cervical\nspine apportionment was assessed fifty per cent (50%) to degenerative changes, ten\nper cent (10%) to the previous July 1, 2008 specific injury and forty per cent (40%) to\nthe June 21, 2013 specific injury. After apportionment the adjusted rating was\ntwenty-four per cent (24%).\n\nThereafter, Dr. Hatch was deposed regarding the application of Labor Code 4664(b)\napportionment based on the prior Stipulation and Award at 33%. In the deposition\nthe doctor was told by applicant’s counsel that the prior award was based on the\nreporting of Dr. Kambiz Hannani. She was then asked if Labor Code Section 4664(b)\nrequired that the level of whole person impairment (WPI) from the prior Award be\nsubtracted from the current WPI to calculate apportionment on this injury. She\ntestified as follows:\n\n“Q: Okay. So Dr. Hannani gave 7 percent for the cervical spine, and under\nLabor Code Section 4664, it says that—under ‘B’ if the applicant has received\na prior award of permanent disability, it shall be conclusively presumed that\nthe prior permanent disability exists at the time of any subsequent industrial\ninjury ... --if the applicant had a 7 percent Whole Person Impairment from the\naward on a prior injury and that level of impairment is conclusively presumed\nto exist at the time of this injury, when you gave the applicant an impairment\nrating on his cervical spine of 20 percent Whole Person Impairment, where\ndoes that leave us with impairment that is apportioned to the 2013 injury?\n\nA: Well, if my impairment rating derived on October 12, 2015 was 20 percent\nof the cervical spine condition and Dr. Hannani had previously provided a 7\npercent Whole Person Impairment, the difference would be a 13 percent\nWhole Person Impairment between these two injuries.\n\nQ: And is that based on reasonable medical probability?\n\nA: That is based on—\n\nQ: And your—\n\nA: — the subtraction method and numbers only.”\n\nDr. Hatch was then asked similar questions regarding the lumbar spine and responded\n[as] follows:\n\n“Q. So assuming that it was 13 percent on the lumbar spine—\n\nA: Prior to the pain add-on, yes.\n\nHERNANDEZ, Antonio 3\n\foO Fe NY DH BF WY YY |\n\nNH N NN NN i a a a\nS aR PF BBRBNXNSSERRRE SSX S\n\nQ. Okay. Then where would that leave us on impairment for this injury for the\nlumbar spine?\n\nA: The difference between what I derived in 2015 compared to Dr. Hannani in\n2009 was 14 percent for the lumbar spine.\n\nQ: And that would be your opinion as the Agreed Medical Examiner in this\ncase based on all the information we provided in today’s deposition?\n\nA: Based on the math.”\n\nAs is clearly set out in Escobedo v. Marshalls [(2005) 70 Cal. Comp. Cases 604\n(Appeals Board en banc opinion), writ den. sub nom. Escobedo vy. Workers’ Comp.\nAppeals Bd. (2005) 70 Cal.Comp.Cases 1506] and_E.L. Yeager Constr’n v. Workers’\nComp. Appeals Bd. (Gatten) [(2006) 142 Cal. App. 4th 922, 52 Cal. Rptr. 3d 133, 71\n\nCal.Comp.Cases 1687], medical opinions on permanent disability and apportionment\nmust be based on substantial medical evidence. In Gatten the Court of Appeal found\nthat to be substantial evidence on the approximate percentage of permanent disability\ndirectly resulting from the subject injury and due to other factors, the medical opinion\nmust be framed on reasonable medical probability.\n\nHere while Dr. Hatch stated that her opinion was based on reasonable medical\nprobability, she apportioned based on speculative facts. There was not substantial\nevidence in the record to support either of the two premises upon which Dr. Hatch’s\nLabor Code 4664(b) analysis was based. While the doctor was told that the prior\naward was based on Dr. Hannani’s medical reporting there was neither a Stipulation\nby the parties to Dr. Hannani’s report being the basis for the 33% prior award, nor\nany stipulation contained within the award itself that it was based on Dr. Hannani’s\nreport. Further, and more importantly there are ambiguities within Dr. Hannani’s\nreport regarding the criteria used to assess disability for the lumbar spine. The doctor\nopted to provide both a DRE and ROM assessment of permanent disability and\noffered no explanation why this was done. Thus, Dr. Hannani’s reporting gives\nwhole person impairment both at 12% using the DRE method and at 13% using the\nROM method,\n\nUsing applicant’s argument that simply subtracting out the WPI from the prior award\nis the correct method of calculating permanent disability in this case, there is another\nproblem. Here the prior award is for 33% permanent disability. Dr. Hannani gave\n7% WPI for the cervical spine, 12% or 13% for the lumbar spine and 0% for the right\nknee. Combining these figures, even using the larger WPI of 13% does not result in\n33% permanent disability.\n\nMore importantly, as indicated in the opinion, WPI is just one factor in determining if\nthere is overlapping permanent disability. Here Dr. Hatch was given a hypothetical\nbased on incorrect facts and not provided with sufficient information regarding the\nlegal principles under Labor Code §4664(b). For this reason a simple subtraction of\n\nHERNANDEZ, Antonio 4\n\foCclUlUOlUlUMOOU NS ODNO ORG DNi\n\nNN Ne a ea ea\n\nWPI was found by me not to constitute substantial evidence of apportionment as\nrequired by Escobedo v, Marshalls (2005) 70 Cal. Comp. Cases 604 (Appeals Board\nen bane decision), Whole Person Impairment is but one component of the\napportionment analysis. In order to constitute substantial evidence on the issue of\napportionment, a medical opinion “must disclose familiarity with the concepts of\napportionment, describe in detail the exact nature of the apportionable disability, and\nset forth the basis for the opinion.” E.L. Yeager Construction v. WCAB (Gatten)\n(2006) 142 Cal. App. 4th 922, 71 Cal.Comp.Cases 1687. Based on the foregoing as\nthere was no establishment of a prior award and overlap of factors of disability,\nwithin the meaning of Labor Code Section 4664(b) and the award was appropriately\napportioned based on Labor Code §4663.\n\nWe agree with the WCJ’s analysis.\n\nApplicant is correct, of course, that section 4664(b) provides: “If the applicant has received a\nprior award of permanent disability, it shall be conclusively presumed that the prior permanent disability\nexists at the time of any subsequent industrial injury.” Accordingly, where there is a prior award of\npermanent disability, apportionment under section 4664(b) is mandated to the extent there is overlap\nbetween the employee’s current permanent disability and the previously awarded permanent disability.\n(Kopping v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1115 [71 Cal.Comp.Cases\n1229].)\n\nOverlap, however, is not established merely by showing that the subsequent injury involved the\nsame body part(s) as the prior injury; instead, the issue of overlap requires a consideration of the factors\nof disability resulting from the two injuries, not merely the body part injured. (Mercier v. Workers’\nComp. Appeals Bd. (1976) 16 Cal.3d 711 [41 Cal.Comp.Cases 205]; State Compensation Ins. Fund vy.\nIndustrial Acc. Com. (Hutchinson) (1963) 59 Cal.2d 45 [28 Cal. Comp. Cases 20].) This need to\nconsider the factors of disability in order to determine overlap was not changed by the Legislature’s\nadoption of section 4664(b). (Kopping, supra, 142 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1107, 1114, 1115; see also, e.g.,\nCarreras v. City of Torrance (2010) 2010 Cal. Wrk. Comp. P.D. LEXIS 403 (Appeals Board panel\ndecision), writ den. sub nom.

In this regard, a medical opinion is not\nsubstantial evidence if it is based on facts no longer germane, on inadequate medical histories or\nexaminations, on incorrect legal theories, or on surmise, speculation, conjecture, or guess. (Escobedo v.\nMarshalls (2005) 70 Cal.Comp.Cases 604, 620 (Appeals Board en banc).)\n\nAs recognized by the WCJ, however, Dr. Hatch’s attempt at a section 4664(b) apportionment\ndetermination in this case was necessarily speculative and not based on adequate facts because: (1) the\nJuly 4, 2010 stipulated 33% permanent disability award did not specify the factors of disability upon\nwhich the award was based; (2) the July 4, 2010 award did not even indicate that Dr. Hannani’s August\n8, 2009 report was the basis for the 33% permanent disability finding; and (3) the whole person\nimpairments listed in Dr. Hannani’s August 8, 2009 report would not justify a 33% permanent disability\nrating. Because Dr. Hatch’s opinion regarding apportionment under section 4664(b) did not constitute\nsubstantial medical evidence, the WCJ properly did not rely upon it.\n\nHere, as discussed above, Dr. Hatch, the AME, concluded that applicant’s current overall cervical\nspine, lumbar spine and right shoulder disability rates 42% before apportionment based on 20% WPI for\nthe cervical spine, 27% WPI for the lumbar spine, and 0% WPI for the right shoulder. In assessing\napportionment, Dr. Hatch opined that only 20% of applicant’s current lumbar disability was due to her\nJune 21, 2013 injury, while 10% of this disability was caused by the prior July 1, 2008 injury and 50%\nwas caused by non-industrial degenerative changes. For the cervical spine, Dr. Hatch apportioned\ncausation 50% to degenerative changes, 10% to the previous July 1, 2008 specific injury, and 40% to the\nJune 21, 2013 specific injury. After apportionment the adjusted rating was 24%, the level of permanent\ndisability after apportionment found by the WCJ.\n\nMl\nMit\nMl\nMt\nMit\n\nHERNANDEZ, Antonio 6\n\foO Oo YI DH UH FF WY YPN\n\na ey\nyD UW FF WY NY HY OS\n\n18\n\n20\n21\n22\n2\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\nWw\n\n \n\nAccordingly, we will affirm the WCJ’s May 18, 2018 decision.\nFor the foregoing reasons,\nIT IS ORDERED that, as our Decision After Reconsideration, that the Findings and Award\n\nissued by the workers’ compensation administrative law judge on May 18, 2018 is AFFIRMED.\n\nWORKERS’ COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD\n\nSs\n\nMARGUERITE SWEENEY\nI CONCUR,\n\n \n\nTHERINE ZALEWS*’\n\nDATED AND FILED AT SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA\nJan 0 3 2020\n\nSERVICE MADE ON THE ABOVE DATE ON THE PERSONS LISTED BELOW AT THEIR\nADDRESSES SHOWN ON THE CURRENT OFFICIAL ADDRESS RECORD.\n\nANTONIO HERNANDEZ\nKEGEL TOBIN & TRUCE\nNAVA & GRAHAM\n\nNPS/bea\n\nHERNANDEZ, Antonio 7\n\f",

This is our Opinion and Decision After Reconsideration.\n\nPhysical Rehabilitation Services (lien claimant) seeks reconsideration of the Joint Findings and\nAward (F&A) issued by the workers’ compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) on September 5,\n2019, wherein the WCJ found in pertinent part that defendant did not have a valid employer-specific\nMedical Provider Network (MPN) in this matter, that the Functional Capacity Evaluation performed by\nlien claimant was not authorized and as such defendant is not liable for the cost thereof, that lien\nclaimant’s request for penalties and interest was denied, and that defendant’s claim for costs was\nwarranted.\n\nLien claimant’s primary contention is that there was good cause for its witness, Sako Arutyunyan,\nnot to appear at the April 22, 2019, and June 17, 2019 lien trials. Therefore the WCI’s findings that “the\nFunctional Capacity Evaluation ... is not payable” and that defendant’s claim for costs “are warranted”\n\nconstitute a violation if its due process rights. !\n\n \n\nWe note that an exhibit is attached to the Petition, which is in violation of WCAB Rule10842 (c). (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, §\n10842.)

We received an Answer from defendant. We also received a\nPetition to File Supplemental Pleading (Supplemental Petition) from lien claimant, Pursuant to WCAB\nRule 10848, the Supplemental Petition was approved and considered. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, §10848.)\n\nWe have considered the allegations in the Petition and the Answer and the contents of the Report\nand the Supplemental Petition. Based upon our review of the record, and for the reasons set forth below,\nwe will rescind the F&A, and return the matter to the WCJ for further proceedings consistent with our\ndecision.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nApplicant, Berta Jimenez (Ramirez), claimed injury arising out of and occurring in the course of\nemployment (AOE/COE) to her left knee, left foot, and left ankle, while employed by defendant as a\nlaborer on September 8, 2016 (ADJ 10606429). She also claimed injury to her bilateral upper and lower\nextremities while employed by defendant as a laborer during the period from September 8, 2015, to\nSeptember 8, 2016 (ADJ10606429). The injury claims were settled by Compromise and Release; the\nWCI issued the Order Approving Compromise and Release on J uly 26, 2018.\n\nDefendant and lien claimant proceeded to trial on April 22, 2019. (Minutes of Hearing and\nSummary of Evidence (MOH/SOE), 4/22/2019.) In the MOH/SOE, the WCJ stated:\n\nThe witness [Mr. Arutyunyan] had a family emergency today. His father\nwas taken to the emergency room this morning. Court finds that good cause\nfor a continuance for the testimony of Mr. Arutyunyan. If Mr. Arutyunyan\nfails to appear, the Court will entertain a petition from defendant for\nreimbursement for their time.\n(MOH/SOE, 4/22/2019, p. 5.)\n\nThe matter was continued to June 17, 2019. (MOH/SOE, 7/17/2019.):The MOH/SOE includes the\nfollowing:\n\nLET THE MINUTES FURTHER REFLECT that this matter was\ncontinued from April 22, 2019, as Physical Rehabilitation Services was\nrequesting another date so their witness, Sako Arutyunyan, could be\navailable. Defendant objected. Court granted the continuance over\nDefendant's objection. | The Court inquired of Ms. Martinez if she has a\nwitness to call. Ms. Martinez indicates that her witness is available by\nphone. The Court indicates that that is not acceptable and inquires if Ms.\n\nJIMENEZ, Berta 2\n\fra\n\nMartinez has a witness available to call to the stand. Ms. Martinez indicates\nshe does not.\n\n2 (MOH/SOE, 7/17/2019, p. 2.)\n3\n4 The issues submitted for decision included the lien of “Physical Rehabilitation Services, for\n5 || services rendered in the form of a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE).” In the MOH/SOE, the WCJ\n6 | also stated that, “Sako Arutyunyan has failed to appear. The Court will entertain a petition from\n7 || Defendant for reimbursement for their time.” (MOH/SOE, 7/17/2019, p. 2.) Defendant filed its Petition\n81| for Costs and Sanctions on June 27, 2019, and the F&A was issued on September 5, 2019. Lien\n9 || claimant’s Petition was timely filed. On November 21, 2019, lien claimant filed its Supplemental\n10 || Petition.\n11 DISCUSSION\n12 In her Opinion on Decision, the WCJ stated:\n13 Defendant’s claim for costs associated with the continued Trial date are\nwarranted. On April 22, 2019, lien claimant requested a’ continuance,\n14 indicating their witness, Sako Arutyunyan, had a family emergency and\n15 could not attend. Lien claimant was warned that if a continuance was\ngranted, and the witness failed to appear at the next hearing, the Court\n16 would not take his failure lightly. Lien claimant’s representative indicated\nhe understood, and insisted upon requesting a continuance. Lien claimant’s\n17 witness, Sako Arutyunya, failed to appear once again at the Lien Trial on\nJune 17, 2019, claiming a travel delay. Lien claimant requested to have the\n18 witness appear by telephone; the request was denied. Sako Arutyunyan’s\n19 failure to appear at Lien Trial on June 17, 2019, is taken as a bad faith\naction, calculated to waste the time of the Court and defense counsel.\n20 Sanctions wiil not be imposed, but defense counsel will be made whole for\nthe time they spent at second day of Trial on June 17, 2019. According to\n21 their petition, $924.00 was expended in relation to the unnecessary Lien\nTrial date of April 22, 2019.\n22 (Opinion on Decision, pp. 2 — 3.)\n23\n24 Lien claimant contends that Mr. Arutyunyan did not attend the April 22, 2019 trial because his\n\n25 || father was taken to the emergency room on that morning (MOH/SOE, 4/22/2019, p. 5) and he did not\n26 || attend the June 17, 2019 trial because his flight from Houston, Texas was delayed due to bad weather\n\n27 || conditions. (Petition, p. 3, Fact 5; Report, p. 6.) As noted above, the WCJ took Mr. Arutyunyan’s failure\n\nJIMENEZ, Berta 3\n\f_\n\noO 0 8 NY DH HW BR WwW bp\n\nNNR Nea a ea ea i\nSRR BR BRY SER ATRGEESHE ST\n\nto appear and testify at the June 17, 2019 trial, “... as a bad faith action, calculated to waste the time of\nthe Court and defense counsel.” (Opinion on Decision, p. 3.) The $924.00 award to defendant was based\non its costs incurred “in relation to the unnecessary Lien Trial date of April 22, 2019,” (Opinion on\nDecision, p. 3.)\n\nHaving reviewed the trial record and the EAMS ADJ record of proceedings, we recognize the\nWCIJ’s and defendant’s frustration in the context of holding two trials, both of which were not attended\nby lien claimant’s witness. However, we also recognize our constitutional mandate “to accomplish\nsubstantial justice in all cases” (Cal. Const., Article XIV, § 4) and the overriding public policy favoring\nthe disposition of cases on their merits. (Bland v. Workmen’s Comp. Appeals Bd. (1970) 3 Cal.3d 324\n[35 Cal.Comp.Cases 513].) All parties in a workers? compensation proceeding are entitled to due\nprocess. (Beverly Hills Multispecialty Group, Inc. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (Pinkney) (1994) 26\nCal.App.4th 789 [59 Cal.Comp.Cases 461].) Here, lien claimant has not had the Opportunity to provide\nevidence on the issue of whether there was good cause for Mr. Arutyunyan’s failure to appear at the\ntrials.\n\nAn award, order or decision by the WCAB must be supported by substantial evidence in light of\nthe entire record. (Lab. Code §§ 5903, 5952; Garza v. Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. (1970) 3 Cal.3d 312,\n317-319 [33 Cal.Comp.Cases 500]; LeVesque v. Workmen’s Comp. Appeals Bd. (1970) 1 Cal.3d 627,\n635-637 [35 Cal.Comp.Cases 16].) Since there was no trial regarding Mr. Arutyunyan’s failure to appear\nat the April 22, 2019 trial, and/or the June 17, 2019 trial, the WCJ’s conclusion that his failure to appear\nwas a bad faith action, calculated to waste the time of the Court and defense counsel, was not based on\nsubstantial evidence.\n\nAccordingly, we rescind the F&A, and return the matter to the WCJ for further proceedings\nconsistent with our decision.\n\nWe note that this Opinion and Decision does not address, and is not a decision, regarding whether\nthere was good cause for Mr. Arutyunyan’s failure to appear at the trials. Nor does it address the merits\nof the lien regarding the Functional Capacity Evaluation. Our Decision is limited to the issue of whether\n\nthere is good cause to award costs to defendant’s counsel.\n\nJIMENEZ, Berta 4\n\n \n\f \n\nOo O8O ID nO FF WwW\n\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\nFor the foregoing reasons,\n\nIT IS ORDERED as the Decision After Reconsideration of the Workers’ Compensation Appeals\nBoard that the Joint Findings and Award issued by the WCJ on September 5, 2019, is RESCINDED and\nthe matter is RETURNED to the WCJ for further proceedings and a new decision consistent with this\nopinion from which any aggrieved person may timely seek reconsideration.\n\nWORKERS’ COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD\n\n  \n \n\nI CONCUR,\n\nKATHERINE WILLIAMS DODD\n\n \n    \n\nHERINE ZALEWS\"’\n\nDATED AND FILED AT SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA\nJAN O 3 2020\n\nSERVICE MADE ON THE ABOVE DATE ON THE PERSONS LISTED BELOW AT THEIR\nADDRESSES SHOWN ON THE CURRENT OFFICIAL ADDRESS RECORD.\n\nAV MANAGEMENT COLLECTION\nDIETZ, GILMOR & CHAZEN\n\nTLH/pc\n\nJIMENEZ, Berta 5\n\f",

This is our Opinion and Decision After Reconsideration. Richard Ledesma (applicant) sought\nreconsideration of the Findings and Order (F&O) issued by a workers’ compensation administrative law\njudge (WCJ) on March 13, 2017. In that decision, the WCJ denied applicant’s appeal of the\nAdministrative Director’s (AD) Independent Medical Review (IMR) Determination that issued on\nAugust 5, 2016. The WCJ found that applicant did not meet his burden to establish that the AD acted\nwithout or in excess of his powers or that IMR determination was based on a plainly erroneous express or\nimplied finding of fact.\n\nApplicant contended that the WCJ erred by denying his appeal of the August 5, 2016 IMR\ndetermination which upheld defendant’s Utilization Review (UR) denial of an electric mobility scooter.\nApplicant argued that both the UR and IMR reviewing physicians should not have based their denial of\nthe mobility scooter on the Official Disability Guidelines (ODG) because the ODG have been removed\nfrom the National Guidelines Clearinghouse database. On that basis, applicant asserts the IMR\ndetermination is based on a plainly erroneous express or implied finding of fact that is a matter of\nordinary knowledge based on the information submitted for review and not a matter subject to expert\n\nopinion.\n\n \n\fThe WCJ has submitted a Report and Recommendation on Petition for Reconsideration (Report),\nrecommending that we remand the matter to the AD to submit the dispute to IMR by a different reviewer.\nDefendant filed an answer. Defendant urged us to uphold the F&O, arguing that applicant has failed to\ndemonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the IMR determination is based on a plainly erroneous\nmistake of fact that is not subject to expert medical opinion.\n\nWe have reviewed the record in this matter and have given due consideration to applicant’s\ncontentions, the analysis and recommendation set forth in the WCI]’s Report, and defendant’s Answer.\nBased upon our review of the record and for the reasons stated below, we affirm the WCJ’s March 13,\n2017 Findings and Order.\n\nFACTUAL SUMMARY\n\n \n\nApplicant, while employed by defendant as a shipping/receiving foreman, sustained industrial\ninjury to his lower back and bilateral knees during the period from August 11, 1989 to March 18, 2010\n(ADJ7217835); on January 11, 1992 (ADJ9049355); on April 15, 1998 (ADJ7217834), and on\nJanuary 1, 1982 (ADJ7732743). On August 14, 2013, an order issued approving a compromise and\nrelease, resolving applicant’s claims with a provision for further medical treatment.\n\nApplicant’s treating physician, Donald D. Kim, M.D., issued an initial report dated March 30,\n2016, stating that, “X-rays shows [sic] that both knees including his right knee is severely arthritic. He is\nmorbidly obese. He does not wish for injections. He is too obese to consider knee replacement.\nTherefore, he is a candidate for electrical scooter so he can at least have somewhat of mobility.\nOtherwise, his mobility is severely restricted.” (Applicant’s Ex. 4, p. 4.)\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Dr. Kim issued a request for authorization (RFA) for an electric scooter.\n(Applicant’s Ex. 5.)\n\nOn May 31, 2016, the UR Determination issued, recommending non-certification (denial) of the\nrequested surgical procedure. In giving the reasons for the determination, the reviewer noted that\napplicant used a cane to walk and that there was no evidence of a lack of mobility or function with other\nassistive devices such as a cane, walker or wheelchair that warranted the use of a scooter. The criteria\n\nMt\n\nLEDESMA, Richard 2\n\n \n\f \n\noO Fm YD DN NW BR WD HHO ow\n\nNN NNN NY Bw Be ew we ewe ew ew ew oe a\nSane SBRkS8& FSeEnpea ESCs\n\nused indicates that, regarding the request for an electric scooter, the California MTUS! and ACOEM?\nwere referenced, and do not specifically address the request for an electric scooter. As the applicable\nguideline for evaluating Dr. Kim’s RFA, the reviewer utilized the ODG, Treatment in Workers’\nCompensation, 2016 ed., Chapter Knee and Leg, power mobility devices.\n\nApplicant disagreed with the UR Determination not to certify Dr. Kim’s RFA, and requested IMR\nof that determination. The AD of the Division of Workers’ Compensation assigned the request to\nMaximus Federal Services (Maximus). On August 5, 2016, Maximus issued a determination finding, as\nrelevant here, that an electrical scooter is not medically necessary and appropriate. That is, Maximus\nupheld the May 31, 2016 UR denial. (Applicant’s Ex. 1.) The IMR determination includes a clinical case\nsummary relied on by Maximus in its evaluation of applicant’s request for IMR.\n\nMaximus states the basis for its determination as follows:\n\nThe Expert Reviewer based his/her decision on the Non-MTUS Official\nDisability Guidelines, Knee, Power Mobility Devices (PMDs)\n\nThe Expert Reviewer’s decision rationale:\n\nThe California MTUS/ACOEM Guidelines do not address the requested\nservice. The Official Disability Guidelines state, powered mobility devices\nare not recommended if the functional mobility deficit can be sufficiently\nresolved by the prescription of a cane or walker, or the patient has\nsufficient upper extremity function to propel a manual wheelchair. The\ndocumentation submitted for review indicated the patient was currently\nambulating with a cane. Therefore, given the patient was not shown to\nhave significant functional mobility deficits that could not be sufficiently\nresolved by the use of a cane, walker, or manual wheelchair, the request\nfor purchase of electrical scooter is not medically necessary. (Applicant’s\nEx, 1, p. 3.)\n\nApplicant appealed the IMR determination, contending that it was not based on accepted peer\n\nreview guidelines, and, therefore, was the result of a plainly erroneous or implied finding of fact that is a\n\neS\n' MTUS is the acronym for the Division of Workers’ Compensation’s Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule. The MTUS,\nwhich is set forth in the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, section 9792.20 et seq., contains a set of guidelines that\nprovide details on which treatments are effective for certain injuries, as well as how often the treatment should be given, the\nextent of the treatment, and surgical considerations.\n\n?

On March 13, 2017, the WCJ issued the F&O in which he\nfound that applicant had not met his burden to establish that the IMR determination was the result of a\nplainly erroneous or implied finding of fact exceeding the AD’s powers. It is from that decision that\napplicant sought reconsideration.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWhen UR denies a medical treatment request on the basis that it is not medically necessary and\nappropriate to cure or relieve the injured employee from the effects of an industrial injury, the employee\ncan appeal such determination by requesting IMR. (Lab. Code3, § 4610.5(d), (e).) Upon assignment of a\ncase for IMR, the designated IMR organization, in this case, Maximus, is required to conduct a prompt\nreview of the pertinent medical records and reports and apply the standards for determination of medical\nnecessity as set forth in section 4610.5(c). Treatment that is “medically necessary” and “medical\nnecessity” in the context of treatment is defined to mean medical treatment that is reasonably required to\ncure or relieve the injured employee of the effects of his or her injury based on standards as set forth in\nthe MTUS adopted by the AD. (Lab. Code, §§ 4600(b), 4610.5(c)(2).) The determination issued by the\nIMR is deemed to be the determination of the AD.\n\nThe AD adopted the MTUS “consisting of section 9792.20 through section 9792.26” of Title 8 of\nthe California Code of Regulations. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 9792.21.)-The MTUS shall incorporate\n“evidence-based, peer-reviewed, nationally recognized standards of care\" recommended by the\nCommission on Health and Safety and Workers’ Compensation (CHSWC) in accordance with section\n77.5. (§ 5307.27.) Thus, the MTUS adopted by the AD must comply with the statutory mandate that it\nbe based on nationally recognized standards,\n\nWithin the MTUS, “nationally recognized” is defined as “published in a peer-reviewed medical\njournal; or developed, endorsed and disseminated by a national organization with affiliates based in two\n\nor more U.S. states and is the most current version.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 9792.20(h).) While\n\n \n\n3 Unless otherwise stated, all further statutory references are to the Labor Code.\n\nLEDESMA, Richard 4\n\n \n\f \n\nlo OD OS DR NH BP WW PB He\n\nNN NN eee ea a a\n\nevidence that a particular guideline is in the National Guidelines Clearinghouse would be evidence that a\nguideline is nationally recognized, it is not necessary for a guideline to be in the clearinghouse to be\nnationally recognized in accordance with rule 9792.20(h). In fact, the ACOEM Guidelines are the basis\nfor much of the MTUS and are also no longer part of the National Guidelines Clearinghouse.*\n\nSection 3202.5 provides, “All parties and lien claimants shall meet the evidentiary burden of\nproof on all issues by a preponderance of the evidence... .” Medically necessary treatment is treatment\nthat is “reasonably required to cure or relieve the injured employee of the effects of his or her injury” and\n“treatment that is based upon the guidelines adopted by the administrative director pursuant to Section\n5307.27.” (§ 4600(b).)\n\nIn addition, section 4604.5 states that the MTUS “shall be presumptively correct on the issue of\nextent and scope of medical treatment. The presumption is rebuttable and may be controverted by a\npreponderance of the scientific medical evidence establishing that a variance from the guidelines\nreasonably is required to cure or relieve the injured worker from the effects of his or her injury. The\npresumption created is one affecting the burden of proof.”\n\nAlthough an IMR determination is presumed to be correct, it is subject to a limited review by the\n\nAppeals Board and can only be set aside when there is proof, by clear and convincing evidence, that one\n\nof five criteria have been met.° (§ 4610.6(h); see also, Stevens v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2015)\n\n \n\n4 Although not relevant to the timeline at issue here, and we make no comment on the demise of the National Guidelines\nClearinghouse database, we note that it has ceased operation. As of June 18, 2018, it has been defunded. In July 2018, it was\nannounced there would be no further updates and the database would no longer be available online.\nhttps://www.ahrg.gov/gam/index.html\n\n5 Section 4610.5(c)(2) includes the following hierarchy of standards:\n\n(A) The guidelines, including the drug formulary, adopted by the administrative director\npursuant to Section 5307.27.\n\n(B) Peer-reviewed scientific and medical evidence regarding the effectiveness of the\ndisputed service.\n\n(C) Nationally recognized professional standards.\n\n(D) Expert opinion\n\n(E) Generally accepted standards of medical practice.\n\n(F) Treatments that are likely to provide a benefit to a patient for conditions for which\nother treatments are not clinically efficacious. (Lab. Code, § 4610.5(c)(2).)\n\nLEDESMA, Richard 5\n\f241 Cal.App.4th 1100-1101.) Among the specified criteria is an allegation that the determination was\nthe result of a plainly erroneous express or implied finding of fact, provided that the mistake of fact is a\nmatter of ordinary knowledge based on the information submitted for review and not a matter subject to\nexpert opinion. (Stevens, supra, 241 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1100-1101.)\n\nWhen we apply the facts before us to the applicable law, we are not persuaded by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the IMR determination was the result of a plainly erroneous finding of fact that\nis a matter of ordinary knowledge, based on the information submitted for review, and not a matter\nsubject to expert opinion. The MTUS is presumed correct, and it is applicant’s burden to rebut it.\n\nApplicant has not established that ODG is no longer nationally recognized or that the AD acted in\nexcess of his authority. Moreover, there is no mistake of fact here that does not require expert opinion\nbecause the applicability of the ODG is not a matter of common knowledge. Furthermore, the removal\nof ODG from the former National Guidelines Clearinghouse does not prove that the ODG no longer\nconstitutes evidence-based, peer-reviewed, nationally recognized standards of care recommended by\nCHSWC in accordance with section 77.5. Therefore, removal from the National Guidelines\nClearinghouse does not establish that the ODG is invalid. (§ 5307.27.)\n\nIn passing, we observe that a UR decision that denies a treatment recommendation is effective for\n12 months from the date of the decision. (§ 4610 (k).) Here, the UR notice and the IMR determination\nupholding the denial of the mobility scooter issued more than 12 months ago. Thus, there is nothing to\npreclude applicant’s treating physician from making a new recommendation for an electrical mobility\nscooter if, in his or her medical opinion, it is medically necessary.\n\nOn this record, applicant has not met his burden to show that the ODG Guideline is not an\n“evidence-based, peer-reviewed, nationally recognized standard,” that the AD acted in excess of his\nauthority, or that the ODG is invalid. Accordingly, we affirm the March 13, 2017 Findings and Order.\n\nMt\nMl\nMt\nMl\n\nLEDESMA, Richard 6\n\f_\n\nFor the foregoing reasons,\n\n \n\n2 IT IS ORDERED that, as our Decision After Reconsideration, the WCJ’s March 13, 2017\n3 || Findings and Order is AFFIRMED.\n\n4\n\n5 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD\n6 —\n\n, < — = -\n\n8 MARGUERITE SWEE\n\n91) I CONCUR,\n10\n\n11 -\n12\n13 DEIDRA E.'LOWE\n14 .\n15\n16\nKATHERINE ZALEWSK!\n\n18 || DATED AND FILED AT SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA\n\n20 JAN O 3 2020\n\nSERVICE MADE ON THE ABOVE DATE ON THE PERSONS LISTED BELOW AT THEIR\nADDRESSES SHOWN ON THE CURRENT OFFICIAL ADDRESS RECORD.\n\n241!

Petitions for Removal were filed\non September 3, 2019, October 16, 2019, and October 17, 2019. We have considered the allegations of\nthe Petitions for Removal and the contents of the reports of the workers’ compensation administrative\nlaw judge (WCJ) with respect thereto. Based on our review of the record, and for the reasons stated in\nthe WCJ’s reports, which we adopt and incorporate, we will deny applicant’s Petitions for Removal.\n\nWe also admonish applicant that repetitive, meritless, and ineffectual filings may lead to\nproceedings for the purpose of declaring applicant a vexatious litigant pursuant to WCAB rule 10782.\nRule 10782 states in its totality as follows:\n\n(a) For purposes of this rule, “vexatious litigant” means:\n\n(1) A party or lien claimant who, while acting in propria persona (i.e., while\nrepresenting himself or herself) in proceedings before the Workers' Compensation\nAppeals Board, repeatedly relitigates, or attempts to relitigate, an issue of law or fact\nthat has been finally determined against that party or lien claimant by the Workers'\nCompensation Appeals Board or by an appellate court;\n\n(2) A party or lien claimant who, while acting in propria persona in proceedings\nbefore the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, repeatedly files unmeritorious\nmotions, pleadings, or other papers, repeatedly conducts or attempts to conduct\nunnecessary discovery, or repeatedly engages in other tactics that are in bad faith, are\nfrivolous, or are solely intended to cause harassment or unnecessary delay; or\n\n(3) A party or lien claimant who has previously been declared to be a vexatious\nlitigant by any state or federal court of record in any action or proceeding based upon\n\f \n\nae\n\noO Oo SIF DH HW FF WY WN\n\nthe same or substantially similar facts, transaction(s), or occurrence(s) that are the\nsubject, in whole or in substantial part, of the party or lien claimant's workers’\ncompensation case.\n\nFor purposes of this rule, the phrase “finally determined” shall mean: (i) that all\nappeals have been exhausted or the time for seeking appellate review has expired; and\n(ii) the time for reopening under Labor Code sections 5410 or 5803 and 5804 has\npassed or, although the time for reopening under those sections has not passed, there\nis no good faith and non-frivolous basis for reopening.\n\n(b) Upon the petition of a party or lien claimant, or upon the motion of any workers’\ncompensation judge or the Appeals Board, a presiding workers’ compensation judge\nof any district office having venue or the Appeals Board may declare a party or lien\nclaimant as a vexatious litigant.\n\n(c) No party or lien claimant shall be declared a vexatious litigant without being\ngiven notice and an opportunity to be heard. If a hearing is requested, the presiding\nworkers' compensation judge or the Appeals Board, in his, her or its discretion, either\nmay take and consider both oral and documentary evidence or may take and consider\nsolely documentary evidence, including affidavits or other written declarations of fact\nmade under penalty of perjury.\n\n(d) Ifa party or lien claimant is declared to be a vexatious litigant, a presiding\nworkers’ compensation judge or the Appeals Board may enter a “prefiling order,” i.e.,\nan order which prohibits the vexatious litigant from filing, in propria persona, any\nApplication for Adjudication of Claim, Declaration of Readiness, petition, or other\nrequest for action by the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board without first\nobtaining leave of the presiding workers' compensation judge of the district office\nwhere the request for action is proposed to be filed or, if the matter is pending before\nthe Appeals Board on a petition for reconsideration, removal, or disqualification,\nwithout first obtaining leave from the Appeals Board. For purposes of this rule, a\n“petition” shail include, but not be limited to, a petition to reopen under Labor Code\nsections 5410, 5803, and 5804, a petition to enforce a medical treatment award, a\npenalty petition, or any other petition seeking to enforce or expand the vexatious\nlitigant's previously determined rights.\n\n(e) Ifa vexatious litigant proposes to file, in propria persona, any Application for\nAdjudication of Claim, Declaration of Readiness, petition, or other request for action\nby the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, the request for action shall be\nconditionally filed. Thereafter, the presiding workers’ compensation judge, or the\nAppeals Board if the petition is for reconsideration, removal, or disqualification, shall\ndeem the request for action to have been properly filed only if it appears that the\nrequest for action has not been filed in violation of subdivision (a). In determining\nwhether the vexatious litigant's request for action has not been filed in violation of\nsubdivision (a), the presiding workers’ compensation judge, or the Appeals Board,\nshall consider the contents of the request for action and the Workers\" Compensation\nAppeals Board's existing record of proceedings, as well as any other documentation\n\nLEE, Tracy 2\n\n \n\fCoC 0 OB ND NW BP WB we\n\nNHN N N NN NN ee ea ea ea ea ea\nSRSRBRPBRBNRR SERRE EBBA\n\nHt\n\nMt\nMt\nMf\nMt\nIf\n\nMt\nIt\nMf\nit\n\nthat, in its discretion, the presiding workers compensation judge or the Appeals\nBoard asks to be submitted. Among the factors that the presiding workers’\ncompensation judge or the Appeals Board may consider is whether there has been a\nsignificant change in circumstances (such as new or newly discovered evidence or a\nchange in the law) that might materially affect an issue of fact or law that was\npreviously finally determined against the vexatious litigant.\n\n(f) If any in propria persona Application for Adjudication of Claim, Declaration of\nReadiness, petition, or other request for action by the Workers' Compensation\nAppeals Board from a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order is inadvertently\naccepted for filing (other than conditional filing in accordance with subdivision (e),\nabove), then any other party or lien claimant may file (and shall concurrently serve on\nthe vexatious litigant and any other affected parties or lien claimants) a notice stating\nthat the request for action is being submitted by a vexatious litigant subject to a\nprefiling order as set forth in subdivision (d). The filing of the notice shall\nautomatically stay the request for action until it is determined, in accordance with\nsubdivision (e), whether the request for action should be deemed to have been\nproperly filed.\n\n(g) A copy of any prefiling order issued by a presiding workers' compensation judge\nor by the Appeals Board shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Appeals Board,\nwho shall maintain a record of vexatious litigants subject to those prefiling orders and\nwho shall annually disseminate a list of those persons to all presiding workers’\ncompensation judges.\n\n(Cal.

Based on our review of the record, we will grant removal,\nrescind the Order, and return this matter to the trial level for further proceedings and a new decision by\nthe WCJ.\n\nRemoval is an extraordinary remedy rarely exercised by the Appeals Board.

(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 274, 281, fn. 2 [70 Cal.Comp.Cases\n\n133, 136, fn. 2].) The Appeals Board will grant removal only if the petitioner shows that substantial\n\n \n\n' The Order indicates that defendant was designated to serve the Order on all parties as shown on the Official Address Record.\nBecause there is no proof of service on file, we are unable to determine when the parties were served with the Order.\n\fo Oo NY DAN BP WY NY\n\n10\nel\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\n \n\nprejudice or irreparable harm will result if removal is not granted. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 10843(a);\nsee also Cortez, supra; Kleemann, supra.) Also, the petitioner must demonstrate that reconsideration\nwill not be an adequate remedy if a final decision adverse to the petitioner ultimately issues. (Cal. Code\nRegs., tit. 8, § 10843(a).)\n\nDecisions of the Appeals Board “must be based on admitted evidence in the record.” (Hamilton\nv. Lockheed Corporation (Hamilton) (2001) 66 Cal.Comp.Cases 473, 476 (Appeals Board en banc).) As\nrequired by Labor Code section 5313 and explained in Hamilton, “the WCJ is charged with the\nresponsibility of referring to the evidence in the opinion on decision, and of clearly designating the\nevidence that forms the basis of the decision.” (Hamilton, supra, at p. 475.) All parties in workers’\ncompensation proceedings retain their fundamental right to due process and a fair hearing under both the\nCalifornia and United States Constitutions. (Rucker v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (2000) 82\nCal.App.4th 151, 157-158, [65 Cal.Comp.Cases 805].) As stated by the California Supreme Court in\nCarstens v. Pillsbury (1916) 172 Cal. 572:\n\n[The] commission, ... must find facts and declare and enforce rights and\nliabilities—in short, it acts as a court, and it must observe the mandate of\nthe constitution of the United States that this cannot be done except after\ndue process of law. (Id. at 577.)\n\nDue process guarantees all parties the right to notice of hearing and a fair hearing. (Rucker, supra,\nat 157-158.) A fair hearing includes, but is not limited to the opportunity to call and cross-examine\nwitnesses; introduce and inspect exhibits; and to offer evidence in rebuttal. (See Gangwish vy. Workers’\nComp. Appeals Bd. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1284, 1295 [66 Cal. Comp. Cases 584]; Rucker, supra, at\n157-158 citing Kaiser Co. v. Industrial Acci. Com.

The parties\n\nstipulated that applicant sustained 14% permanent disability as a result of a cumulative trauma injury to\nhis back ending on February 25, 2014. After the Stipulated Award was approved, New York Marine and\nGeneral Insurance Company filed a timely Petition for Contribution pursuant to Labor Code! section\n5500.5 against Commerce and Industry Insurance Company\n\nDefendant Commerce and Industry contends that the WCJ erred in setting the matter for trial,\narguing that a Petition for Contribution is subject to mandatory arbitration.\n\nWe have considered the Petition and we have reviewed the record in this matter. We have\nreceived a Report and Recommendation on Petition for Removal (Report), from the WCJ recommending\n\nthat the petition be denied. For the reasons discussed below, we will grant removal, rescind the order\n\n \n\n| All further statutory references are to the Labor Code.\n\f \n\nsetting the matter for trial and find that the dispute between defendants is subject to mandatory\narbitration.\n\nWhen an employee sustains a cumulative trauma injury, the employee may pursue his or her\nclaim for benefits against any one or more of successive employers or insurers that employed or insured\nthe employee during a maximum one-year injury period. (Lab. Code, § 5500.5.) If there are multiple\ninsurers during a cumulative trauma period, the insurers are jointly and severally liable for the entire\naward, but may seek contribution from each other during separate proceedings. (Lab. Code, § 5500.5(e);\nDenny’s Inc. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (Bachman) (2003) 104 Cal. App. 4th 1433 [68\nCal.Comp.Cases 1].)\n\nIf, as in this case, an applicant elects to proceed against a single insurer, the insurer is entitled\nunder Labor Code section 5500.5 to seek contribution for awarded benefits from the remaining insurers\nin subsequent proceedings. (See Schrimpf v. Consolidated Film Industries, Inc. (1977) 42\nCal.Comp.Cases 602 [en banc].) This procedure is intended to promote a prompt determination of an\ninjured worker's entitlement to workers’ compensation benefits. (Rex Club v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals\nBd. (Oakley-Clyburn) (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1465 [62 Cal.Comp.Cases 441].) A decision or settlement\nin the case in chief between the applicant and the elected against insurer is not res judicata, and issues of\nliability among the defendants are decided de novo. (Greenwald v. Carey Dist. Co. (Greenwald) (1981)\n46 Cal.Comp.Cases 703 (Appeals Board en banc).)\n\nDisputes over the right of contribution pursuant to Section 5500.5 are required to be submitted to\narbitration and the cost of arbitration is split between the parties. (Lab. Code, §§ 5273, $275(a).)\nArbitrators have all of the duties and responsibilities of workers’ compensation administrative law judges\nexcept arbitrators do not have the power of contempt and do not have the power “to order the injured\nworker to be evaluated by a qualified medical evaluator pursuant to Sections 5701 and 5703.5.” (Lab.\nCode, §5272(a).) The arbitrator’s decision “shall have the same force and effect as an award, order, or\ndecision of a workers’ compensation judge.” (Lab. Code, § 5277(c).)\n\nFinally, we note that Section 5270 provides that the Labor Code sections providing for arbitration\n\n“shall not apply in cases where an injured employee or dependent is involved unless the employee or\n\nREASNER, Larry 2\n\f_\n\ndependent is represented by an attorney.” Here, applicant has elected against a defendant and settled his\ncase. The applicant is not “involved” in the dispute between insurers over Section 5500.5 contribution.\nTherefore, the dispute should be arbitrated.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons,\n\nIT IS ORDERED that defendant’s Petition for Removal of the November 6, 2019 Order is\nGRANTED.\n\nco OD ID DH HW BF WY HD\n\nNN NH NN NN a ea a i\nSaocaos® SRBPNRNBSeSE BARBED H IS\n\nMt\nMl\nMl\nMl\nMl\nMl\nMt\nIt\nMt\nMl\nMt\nMl\nMl\nMl\nMf\nM\nMl\nMl\nMl\nMl\nMl\n\nREASNER, Larry\n\f \n\n1 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, as the Decision After Removal of the Workers’ Compensation\nAppeals Board, that November 6, 2019 Order is RESCINDED and the following is SUBSTITUTED in\nits place:\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\n1.

This is\nour Decision After Reconsideration.\n\nIn the Findings and Award of January 16, 2019, the Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) found,\nin relevant part, that on October 27, 2010, applicant sustained industrial injury to his low back and\npsyche, but not to his left knee, causing permanent disability of 69 percent after apportionment, and the\nneed for further medical treatment.\n\nApplicant filed a timely petition for reconsideration of the WCJ’s decision. Applicant contends\nthat the WCI erred in not addressing applicant’s claim that the medical opinions of Dr. Conrad and Dr.\nPetrakis do not support a finding of apportionment, and that the reports of applicant’s vocational expert,\nMr. Jeff Malmuth, support a finding of permanent and total disability.\n\nDefendant filed an answer.\n\nThe WCJ submitted a Report and Recommendation.\n\nBased on our review of the record and applicable law, we conclude that the record is incomplete\nand prevents us from undertaking a meaningful review of the allegations raised in applicant’s petition for\nreconsideration. Therefore, we will rescind the WCJ’s decision, and we will return this matter to the trial\n\nlevel for further proceedings and new decision by the WCJ.\n\n \n\n \n\f \n\nIn Hamilton v. Lockheed Corporation (2001) 66 Cal.Comp.Cases 473, 477 [Appeals Board en\nbanc], the Board discussed the requirements of a proper record as follows:\n\nIn summary, the Labor Code and the Board's rules contain explicit\ninstructions concerning the contents of the record of a case. It is the\nresponsibility of the parties and the WCJ to ensure that the record is\ncomplete when a case is submitted for decision on the record. At a\nminimum, the record must contain, in properly organized form, the issues\nsubmitted for decision, the admissions and stipulations of the parties, and\nadmitted evidence.\n\nIn this case, the WCJ issued an order submitting the matter for decision after the trial hearing of\nNovember 28, 2018. The Summary of Evidence includes applicant’s extensive trial testimony. The\nMinutes of Hearing include the parties’ stipulations and issues. The Minutes of Hearing also include a\nlist of joint exhibits (medical reports of Dr. Conrad and Dr. Petrakis), a list of applicant’s exhibits\n(reports of Mr. Malmuth, vocational expert), and a list of defendant’s exhibits (wage statement, job\ndescription, and reports of Mr. Cohen, vocational expert). The Minutes of Hearing recite that the above\nexhibits all were admitted in evidence, but the Electronic Adjudication Management System (EAMS)\nidentifies only Mr. Malmuth’s reports as actually having been admitted into evidence. Otherwise, the\nexhibits listed above are found in EAMS in scattershot fashion, and it is unclear whether the record as\ndescribed in the November 28, 2018 Minutes of Hearing is complete. Thus, the record in this case does\nnot comply with Hamilton, supra, and it does not comply with Hernandez v. Staff Leasing (2011) 76\nCal.Comp.Cases 343 [Significant Panel Decision]. In the latter case, the Board explained that the\nrequirements of Hamilton also apply to records created in EAMS. The record being inadequate in this\ncase, we will rescind the WCJ’s decision and return this matter to the trial level for the creation of a\nproper record, and for a new decision by the WCJ.\n\nIn passing, we note that in her Opinion on Decision, the WCJ refers to a report of Dr. Petrakis\ndated January 13, 2016, in which the doctor is said to have provided a mental residual functional capacity\nassessment, noting applicant will be “off task up to 20 percent of the day.” However, the WCJ’s Opinion\non Decision apparently relies upon the defense vocational expert, Mr. Cohen, without explaining how\n\nMr. Cohen or Mr. Malmuth address applicant’s employability in view of Dr. Petrakis’s opinion that he\n\nSANDOVAL, Paulin 2\n\f \n\nw\n\noo Oo Yt Dn AW Ff\n\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\nwill be “off task” for 20% of the workday, apparently at irregular intervals. Upon return of this matter to\nthe trial level for the creation of a proper record, we believe this issue should be revisited by the WCJ. It\nshould be noted, however, that we express no final opinion on any issue raised by applicant’s petition for\nreconsideration.

Ma, M.D., and from- internal medicine-rheumatology QME Seymour Levine, M.D., constitute\nsubstantial evidence that applicant did not sustain injury AOE/COE, and that with those reports\ndefendant rebutted the Labor Code section 5402 presumption of compensability.!\n\nWe received a Report and Recommendation on Petition for Reconsideration (Report) from the\nWCJ recommending the Petition be denied. We did not receive an Answer from applicant.\n\nWe have considered the allegations in the Petition and the contents of the Report. Based upon our\nreview of the record, and for the reasons set forth below, we will grant reconsideration, rescind the F&A\nand substitute a new Joint Findings of Fact and Order, finding that applicant did not sustain injury\n\nAOE/COE in case number ADJ9849202, and in case number ADJ9849201.\n\n \n\n' All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise noted.\n\fBACKGROUND\n\nApplicant claimed injury to his back, upper extremities, hips, legs, and knees, while employed by\ndefendant as a truck driver on August 15, 2014 (ADJ 9849202), and he claimed injury to his back, upper\nextremities, hips, legs, and knees, while employed by defendant as a truck driver during the period from\n1980 through December 13, 2014 (ADJ9849201).\n\nOn September 23, 2015, applicant was evaluated by orthopedic QME Dr. Ma. (Def. Exh. A, Dr.\nMa, 9/23/2015.) Dr. Ma examined applicant and took a history, but he did not receive applicant’s\nmedical records to review. The doctor stated that he needed to review the medical records before\nproviding any opinions regarding the injury claims. (Def. Exh. A, p. 14.) In his supplemental report, after\nreviewing the medical record, Dr. Ma concluded:\n\nIn summary, these medical records show that the patient had a significant\nprior work injury which caused him pain about his back since 1988 or 1989\n(sic). In addition, the patient has severe rheumatoid arthritis on a non-\nindustrial basis as another source of his pain. The rheumatoid arthritis is\nsevere and advanced and it has completely destroyed his hip joints. This is\non a pre-existing basis prior to his automobile accident of August 15, 2014.\nThe patient already had been treating for his back pain, hip pain etc. prior\nto the automobile accident of August 15, 2014. The medical records from\nKaiser show that he continued having the same treatment and same\nsymptoms after the automobile accident of August 15, 2014 through\nDecember 2014. None of the Kaiser records show that there was any\nchange in his symptoms after the automobile accident of August 15, 2014.\nAll of the records show that they treated him for the same symptoms and\nfindings before and after the automobile accident of August 15, 2014. It\nwas not until he was referred by his attorney to Dr. Sobol, who saw the\npatient initially on January 15, 2015 that there is now a claim for industrial\ncausation. {| Based solely on the reproducible information on hand, this\nexaminer finds no industrial causation on a specific basis or a cumulative\ntrauma basis.\n\n(Def. Exh. B, Dr. Ma, 10/22/2015, pp. 23 - 24.)\n\nApplicant was initially seen by Edwin Haronian, M.D., on May 31, 2016, and Dr. Haronian\nbecame applicant’s primary treating physician. (Joint Exh. Z, Dr. Levine, 2/9/2019, pp. 4 — 6, record\nreview.) In his August 30, 2016 report, Dr. Haronian stated:\n\nFollowing review of the submitted records, I am led to reconsider my\nopinion. Based on review of the available information, it is my opinion that\nthe patient's bilateral hip impairment and disability was caused 80% by the\n\nSCOGGINS, Michael 2\n\f—\n\nwork-related continuous trauma to December 13, 2014, with remaining\n20% caused by preexisting degenerative change. My opinions regarding\nissues of impairment and disability, otherwise remain unchanged from\nthose set forth in my May 31, 2016, permanent and stationary report.\n\n(App. Exh, 17, Dr. Haronian, 8/30/2016, p. 24.)\n\noo eo YI DH HW BB WW HY\n\nThe parties proceeded to trial on July 17, 2017. The parties’ exhibits were admitted into evidence\n\nand applicant testified on his own behalf? (Minutes of Hearing and Summary of Evidence (MOH/SOE),\n7/17/2017.) In the Minutes of Hearing, the WCIJ stated that:\n\n[D]espite all the issues being read into the record on both cases, the trial, at\nthis time, will be limited to AOE/COE issue only. All other issues are\nreserved.\n\n(MOH/SOE, 7/17/2017, p. 7.)\n\nNN Se Be Be eB Be ee Oe Oe a\nSR RPE SORRBR SREB ERBDH IS\n\nThe WCJ issued a Findings and Award on August 28, 2017. Defendant filed a Petition for\nReconsideration on September 11, 2017, and the WCJ issued an Order Rescinding Findings and Award\n\non September 18, 2017. At the October 6, 2017 status conference, the matter was ordered off calendar for\n\nfurther development of the record. (Minutes of Hearing, 10/6/2017.)\n\nOn May 25, 2018, applicant was evaluated by rheumatology QME, Seymour Levine, M.D. After\nexamining applicant, taking a history, and reviewing the medical record, the doctor’s “diagnostic\nimpression” regarding applicant included rheumatoid arthritis, end stage destructive arthritis of the left\n\nhip, and post March 14, 2018 right total hip replacement surgery. (Joint Exh. X, Dr. Levine, 6/24/2018,\n\np. 23.) Dr. Levine concluded that:\n\n...There is nothing unusual about the development and progression of\ntheumatoid arthritis in this patient noting its predilection for his hips and\nhands. It is unpredictable in any given patient as to what joints may be\ninvolved with the rheumatoid process which tends to be a progressive,\nmigratory, and additive condition. Having had the opportunity to evaluate\nthis patient and review his extensive medical records, I am in agreement\nwith Dr. Ma that the rheumatoid arthritis condition in this patient is non-\nindustrial and was not exacerbated or aggravated by the nature of this\npatient's work as a truck driver. The cumulative trauma that he has claimed\n\n \n\n2 We note that applicant’s exhibits 1 — 6 were “marked for ID only” i.e. they were not admitted into evidence. (MOH/SOE,\n\n7/17/2017, pp. 5 — 6.)\n\n3 an Order changing venue to the Oxnard District Office was issued on October 2, 2018.\nSCOGGINS, Michael 3\n\fand the specific injury noted is not responsible for this patient developing\nrheumatoid arthritis, nor exacerbating or aggravating this condition in this\npatient. Destructive arthritis in the patient's hips is entirely due to the non-\nindustrial rheumatoid arthritis. This is based on reasonable medical\nprobability.\n\n(Joint Exh. X, pp. 26 — 27.)\n\nIn his supplemental report, Dr. Levine stated:\n\nHaving had the opportunity to review the additional records regarding this\npatient's case, I see nothing in them that would cause me to change the\nopinions and conclusions that I reached in my report of June 24, 2018.\n(Joint Exh. Z, Dr. Levine, 2/9/2019, p. 8.)\n\nDr. Levine’s deposition was taken on June 24, 2019. (Joint Exh. Y, Dr. Levine, 6/24/2019,\ndeposition transcript.) The doctor was asked several questions regarding his opinion that applicant’s\nrheumatoid arthritis was not work related. He repeatedly explained the reasoning for his opinion. For\n\nexample, he stated:\n\nWell, it's interesting you -- you bring that up it's thought that at least if you\nare using a joint that is acutely involved with the rheumatoid process and\noveruse it, you can exacerbate symptoms. You might increase pain, there\nmay be even increase in swelling in the joint. § Where the argument comes\nup is how can it make the disease worse. In other words, aggravation\nmeans a permanent change in the disease, because this is a disease given by\nthe immune process. And how do you prove that the immune process is\nadversely affected by trauma? 4 Well, there -- there's speculation. One\ncould say, well, the trauma has injured the cartilage. If you injure the\ncartilage, you're going to call forth an inflammatory reaction. And it may\nmake that joint worse. { Has that held up in the literature? Yes. When\npeople have fractured involved joints or done something fairly severe to\nthem, you may see exacerbation and aggravation of the process, but there is\nnothing at all unusual about that. § To reach the extent of the changes that\nwere seen on the x-rays done four months before the specific injury, means\nthat this patient was suffering, but it's a tribute to him. This is what he did\nand he didn't know anything else to do in life except to keep on marching\non until he couldn't do it anymore. I don't see that as being work related. I\nthink this would have been what would have happened to him, really, had\nhe never worked. And you ask me is that speculation? Is that guesswork?\nIt's not. It's really based upon long-term clinical experience and\nrecognizing the natural history of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n(Joint Exh. Y, pp. 15 — 16; see also pp. 17-18, 23 — 24.)\n\nIn his July 21, 2019 “supplemental medical-legal report,” having reviewed Dr. Levine’s reports,\n\nSCOGGINS, Michael 4\n\fSOD me YD HW B&B WH\n\nNN a a a ea a a\nSe R28 BSPESSeERVSERESS\n\nDr. Haronian stated:\n\n[T]here was indication that the patient was a driver for direct transit. There\nwas indication that the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident.\nThere was also indication that the patient was performing repetitive\nactivities resulting in a continuous trauma injury. He was working as a\ntruck driver. There is evidence from the description that was provided by\nthe patient that the fact that he was driving for over 34 years, he was\nexposed to repetitive microtrauma while sitting in a truck. The patient: was\ndriving and the repetitive jerking of his body while going over potholes and\nother obstacles in the road is likely to be injurious to his hips. Furthermore,\nthe impact of the injury from the motor vehicle accident also damaged the\npatient's hips. { In this case, when I saw the patient on May 31, 2016, I\nhave opined that the patient's hips were related to the continuous trauma\ninjury. However, at this time based on the new information, I'am amending\nmy opinions based on reasonable medical probability. It is reasonable to\nindicate that in regards to the hips bilaterally, 20% of the patient's disability\nand impairment would be attributed to the rheumatoid arthritis and 20%\nwould be attributed to the specific injury, and 60% would be attributed to\nthe continuous trauma injury. The above opinion is being provided based\non reasonable medical probability. This is also based on the description of\nthe patient's work that he performed over many years.\n\n(App. Exh. 21, Dr. Haronian, 7/21/2019, pp. 1 -2.)\n\nThe parties proceeded to trial on August 28, 2019. In the MOH/SOE, the WCI stated that the\nparties augmented the previous trial record with reports from QME Dr. Levine, and treating physician,\nDr. Haronian. (MOH/SOE, 8/28/2019, p. 2.) Additional exhibits were taken into evidence (Applicant’s\nexhibits 16 — 21 and Joint exhibits X, Y, and Z) and it appears that the matter was submitted for decision\nlimited to the issue of injury AOE/COE, regarding both injury claims.\n\nDISCUSSION .\n\nAs stated above, applicant claimed injuries to his back, upper extremities, hips, legs, and knees.\nBased on our review of the record, including the Report and the WCJ’s Opinion on Decision, it appears\nthat the WCJ relied on the opinions of Dr. Ma and Dr. Levine in finding that applicant did not sustain\ninjury to his upper extremities, hips, legs.\n\nHowever, with regard to the knees and the low back, this court felt they\ncould not be summarily dismissed or attributed solely to the R.A. nor to the\nprior MVA in 1988, 26 years prior. Therefore this court sided with the\nprimary treating physician’s opinions of Dr. Sobol and Dr. Haronian, who\nhave found injury AOE/COE all along as to all body parts at issue. (Report,\n\nSCOGGINS, Michael 5\n\n \n\f \n\nco Oo YD HW BR WwW\n\n10\nie\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\n \n\np. 3.)\n\nWe first note that at the July 17, 2017 trial, applicant’s exhibits 1 — 6 were “marked for ID only”\nand there is no ruling or order admitting them into evidence. A decision “...must be based on admitted\nevidence in the record.” (Hamilton v. Lockheed Corporation (2001) 66 Cal.Comp.Cases 473, 476\n(Appeals Board en banc).) Based thereon, the May 31, 2016, August 8, 2016, October 24, 2016, and\nJanuary 16, 2017, reports from Dr. Haronian, and the May 18, 2015, and February 24, 2015, reports from\nDr. Sobol are not evidence and cannot be the basis for the decision in this matter.‘\n\nIt is well established that any award, order or decision of the Appeals Board must be supported by\nsubstantial evidence. (Lab. Code, § 5952(d); Lamb v. Workmen’s Comp. Appeals Bd. (1974) 11 Cal.3d\n274, 281 [39 Cal.Comp.Cases 310]; Garza v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. (1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317\n[35 Cal.Comp.Cases 500].) Also, the relevant and considered opinion of one physician, though\ninconsistent with other medical opinions, may constitute substantial evidence. (Place v. Workers’ Comp.\nAppeals Bd. (1970) 3 Cal.3d 372, [35 Cal.Comp.Cases 525].) To be substantial evidence a medical\nopinion must be framed in terms of reasonable medical probability, it must not be speculative, it must be\nbased on pertinent facts and on an adequate examination and history, and it must set forth reasoning in\nsupport of its conclusions. (Escobedo v. Marshalls (2005) 70 Cal.Comp.Cases 604 (Appeals Board en\nbanc).)\n\nDr. Ma and Dr. Levine both examined applicant, took a history, and reviewed the extensive\nmedical record. As noted above, they both provided detailed explanations of the reasoning for their\nrespective conclusions that applicant’s symptoms were caused by his pre-existing conditions and were\nnot related to his employment as a truck driver. They both explained how and why they reached their\nconclusions that applicant’s conditions are not the result of an injury AOE/COE. (Def. Exh. B, Joint\nExhs. X and Y.) As such, the reports from Dr. Ma, and the reports, including the deposition testimony,\nfrom Dr. Levine, constitute substantial evidence.\n\nDr. Haronian addressed the issue of injury AOE/COE, in his August 30, 2016 report, (App. Exh.\n\n \n\n4 Subsequent reports from Dr. Haronian were admitted into evidence at the August 28, 2019 trial, As such, those reports are\nevidence to be considered. (App. Exhs. 16 ~ 21 )\n\nSCOGGINS, Michael 6\n\f \n\nSo OCS Tt DN BB WwW HH\n\nNN NN eB ee a ea ea a a\n\n17) and in his July 21, 2019 report. (App. Exh. 21.) Our review of those reports, as quoted above,\nindicates that Dr. Haronian stated his conclusions regarding injury AOE/COE and permanent disability,\nbut he did not explain his analysis or his reasoning for his opinions. Further, both reports appear to be\nlimited to the issue of injury AOE/COE regarding applicant’s hips. The doctor stated his opinion that\napplicant sustained an industrial injury to his hips, but he did not mention the alleged injury to\napplicant’s back and/or legs. Thus, Dr. Haronian’s reports are not substantial evidence and therefore\ncannot be the basis for a finding of injury AOE/COE, to applicant’s back and knees.\n\nRegarding the “presumption of compensability” which applicant asserted at the July 17, 2017\ntrial, section 5402 states in part that:\n\n(b) If liability is not rejected within 90 days after the date the claim form is\nfiled under Section 5401, the injury shall be presumed compensable under\nthis division. The presumption of this subdivision is rebuttable only by\nevidence discovered subsequent to the 90-day period.\n\n(Lab. Code, § 5402.)\n\nDefendant does not dispute the fact that the injury claims were not denied within 90 days.\nHowever, the November 4, 2015 Notice Regarding Denial of Workers’ Compensation Benefit states:\n\nAfter careful consideration of all available information, we are denying\nliability for your claim of injury. Workers' compensation benefits are being\ndenied because the Panel QME, Dr. Ma, has examined you and reviewed\nall your prior medical records and determined that you have not sustained\nany work related injury. Your attorney has a copy of the medical report\ndated 10/22/15. :\n\n(Def. Exh. D)\n\nDr. Ma was designated to be the QME pursuant to section 4062.2. (Lab. Code, § 4062.2.) The\nreport from Dr. Ma was the basis for defendant’s denial of applicant’s claims.
