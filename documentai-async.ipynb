      "opinion that 10% of the disability resulting from the original carpal tunnel syndrome condition\n",
      "was non-industrial. On those facts, the Court of Appeal framed the issue as \"whether an employer\n",
      "is responsible for both the medical treatment and any disability arising directly from unsuccessful\n",
      "medical intervention, without apportionment.\" (Hikida, supra, 12 Cal.App.5th at 1260, italics\n",
      "added.) Although the Court answered yes to that specific question, the Court further explained in\n",
      "pertinent part: \"Nothing in the 2004 legislation [broadening application of apportionment] had\n",
      "any impact on the reasoning that has long supported the employer's responsibility to compensate\n",

      "sustained injury arising out of and in the course of employment to her right knee and left knee.\n",
      "Defendant accepted the claim and provided medical treatment and indemnity benefits.\n",
      "The matter went to trial on the issue of occupational group number, permanent disability,\n",
      "apportionment, and attorney's fees. Applicant testified at trial and the parties offered joint exhibits\n",
      "of a benefit printout and three QME Reports by Dr. James Han. In the Finding and Award, it was\n",
      "found Applicant established the occupational group number of 460, there was permanent disability\n",
      "of 21% after apportionment, and a reasonable attorney fee was 15% of the permanent disability\n",
      "awarded. In response, Applicant filed a Petition for Reconsideration contending the findings of\n",
      "apportionment by Dr. Han were are not substantial medical evidence.\n",
      "III\n",
      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "Applicant had an initial QME evaluation with Dr. Han on April 13, 2017 where she was found not\n",
      "permanent and stationary. (Joint Exhibit BB) She returned for a re-evaluation on March 21, 2019,\n",
      "which resulted in a report dated April 5, 2019 wherein Dr. Han provided a record review, physical\n",
      "examination, and interview of Applicant. He diagnosed Applicant with bilateral post-traumatic\n",
      "osteoarthritis of the knee post knee replacement, internal derangement of the right knee with lateral\n",
      "meniscus tear and internal derangement of the left knee with lateral and medial meniscus tear. He\n",
      "described Applicant's medical history which included prior bilateral meniscectomies in 1995 and\n",
      "6\n",
      "1996 and a left ACL reconstruction in 1992. He found industrial causation and 15% whole person\n",
      "impairment for each knee based on bilateral total knee replacement surgeries. (Joint Exhibit CC)\n",
      "The basis for apportionment must be clear; the medical-legal report must “describe in detail the\n",
      "exact nature of the apportionable disability, and set forth the basis for the opinion.\" Escobedo v.\n",
      "Marshalls (2007) 70 Cal. Comp. Cases 604, 621. This means that the medical-legal report must\n",
      "explain the nature of the non-industrial factor, and how and why the non-industrial factor is\n",
      "responsible for part of the disability. Id. at 622. In his report dated report dated April 5, 2019, Dr.\n",
      "Han apportioned 60% of the disability to pre-existing and 40% to the industrial injury. He\n",
      "explained that Applicant had prior surgeries, fell off a curb in 2016, and had obesity resulting in\n",
      "degenerative changes that made the bilateral total knee replacement surgeries necessary, which is\n",
      "the basis for the permanent disability. (Joint Exhibit CC)\n",
      "In his supplemental report dated July 5, 2019, Dr. Han returned to the issue of apportionment,\n",
      "explaining that Applicant had a long history of pre-existing knee conditions, injuries, surgeries,\n",
      "and obesity that contributed to the need for total knee replacements bilaterally. (Joint Exhibit DD)\n",
      "In his initial report, Dr. Han indicated that Applicant already had significant pre-existing\n",
      "derangements within the right knee for which she was receiving ongoing care. He found that the\n",
      "pre-existing conditions had become significantly worse since the specific incident of March 6,\n",
      "2015. He described the previous right knee arthroscopy in 1995 with residual symptoms and the\n",
      "right knee x-ray from 2012 that revealed degenerative changes that progressed since the prior study\n",
      "in 2007. He described another prior right knee injury on October 21, 2013 and a left knee x-ray\n",
      "from that date revealing moderate tri-compartmental joint space narrowing and osteoarthritis. He\n",
      "described the right knee x-ray done after this specific injury, which revealed similar degenerative\n",
      "findings as the x-ray from 2012. Based on objective findings, Dr. Han opined that the degenerative\n",
      "findings in both knees were predominately pre-existing and Applicant would have required a total\n",
      "knee replacement at some point, which was the basis for the permanent disability finding. (Joint\n",
      "Exhibit BB) Dr. Han adequately explains the nature of the non-industrial factors, which include\n",
      "bilateral meniscectomies and a left ACL reconstruction, and how they relate to the permanent\n",
      "disability.\n",
      "The reports by Dr. Han rate as follows:\n",
      "Right knee\n",
      "Left knee\n",

      "9, Marc L. Nehorayan, M.D., January 21, 2016, p. 10.) Regarding the cause of applicant's\n",
      "psychiatric condition, Dr. Nehorayan stated:\n",
      "There is reasonable medical probability to identify that greater than 50% of the\n",

      "patient's traumatic experience the patient endured while working as a social\n",

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "Labor Code section 4660.1 states in part, that:\n",
      "This section applies to injuries occurring on or after January 1, 2013. ¶ ..\n",
      "(c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the impairment ratings for sleep\n",
      "dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, or psychiatric disorder, or any combination\n",
      "thereof, arising out of a compensable physical injury shall not increase. This\n",
      "section does not limit the ability of an injured employee to obtain treatment for\n",
      "sleep dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, or psychiatric disorder, if any, that are a\n",
      "consequence of an industrial injury. ... ¶(2) An increased impairment rating for\n",
      "psychiatric disorder is not subject to paragraph (1) if the compensable\n",
      "psychiatric injury resulted from either of the following: (A) Being a victim of a\n",
      "violent act or direct exposure to a significant violent act within the meaning of\n",
      "Section 3208.3. (B) A catastrophic injury, including, but not limited to, loss of\n",
      "a limb, paralysis, severe burn, or severe head injury.\n",
      "(Lab. Code, § 4660.1.)¹\n",
      "The nature of the injury sustained is a question of fact for the WCJ. (Western Growers Ins.\n",
      "Co. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (Austin) (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227, 234 [58 Cal.Comp.Cases\n",
      "323].) Whether an injury is “catastrophic\" under section 4660.1(c)(2)(B) is therefore a factual/legal\n",
      "issue for the WCJ to determine. However, it must be noted that section 4660.1(c) does not apply\n",
      "to a psychiatric injury, or injury in the form of sleep dysfunction, if the injuries are directly caused\n",
      "by events of employment. Section 4660.1(c)(1) only bars an increase in the employee's permanent\n",
      "impairment rating for a psychiatric injury/sleep dysfunction that is a compensable consequence of\n",
      "¹ All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise noted.\n",
      "3\n",
      "a physical injury occurring on or after January 1, 2013. (Kris Wilson v. State of California - Cal\n",

      "v. Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (Montenegro) (2016 W/D) 81 Cal.Comp.Cases 611.)\n",
      "Therefore, the issue of whether applicant's psychiatric condition and sleep disorder are a direct\n",
      "result of the October 8, 2013 incident, or whether they are the consequence of the orthopedic\n",
      "injuries, must be determined. Once that issue is resolved, the issue of whether the provisions of\n",
      "section 4660.1 are applicable in this matter can be addressed.\n",
      "Although it appears that Dr. Nehorayan concluded applicant's psychiatric condition was\n",
      "caused by the October 8, 2013 incident, he did not explain the reasoning or analysis that was the\n",
      "basis for his opinion. Also, review of Dr. Navab's report indicates that he did not address the issue\n",
      "of whether applicant's sleep disorder was a direct result of the October 8, 2013 incident, or whether\n",
      "it was a consequence of the orthopedic injuries. Thus, the doctors' reports are not substantial\n",
      "evidence regarding the issues discussed herein.\n",
      "It is well established that any award, order, or decision of the Appeals Board must be\n",
      "supported by substantial evidence. (Lab. Code, § 5952(d); Lamb v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd.\n",
      "(1974) 11 Cal.3d 274, 281 [39 Cal.Comp.Cases 310]; Garza v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd.\n",
      "(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317 [35 Cal.Comp.Cases 500].) The Appeals Board has the discretionary\n",
      "authority to develop the record when the medical record is not substantial evidence or where there\n",
      "is insufficient evidence to determine an issue that was submitted for decision. (Lab. Code, §5701,\n",

      "Cal.Comp.Cases 261].) Clearly, the issue of permanent disability caused by the October 8, 2013\n",
      "injury is a threshold issue in this matter, and in order to determine that issue the record must be\n",
      "further developed.\n",
      "When the medical record requires further development, the record should first be\n",

      "At trial, defendant's supervisor, Juan Saragosa, testified as follows:\n",
      "Q. BY MS. HOFFMAN: So with respect to the Santa Monica project, employees\n",
      "were given a stipend for gas; is that correct?\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER: A what for gas?\n",
      "Q. BY MS. HOFFMAN: They were given money for gas?\n",
      "A. Yes. I believe I [sic] was $125 or something like that.\n",
      "Q. And was that given to each employee that came from the Oakland area do you\n",
      "know to the Santa Monica area?\n",
      "A. Yes, to all of the employees that went from here, it was given to all of them.\n",
      "Q. And was that just a one-time stipend so that they can drive at the beginning of\n",
      "the project and back at the end of the project; correct?\n",
      "THE WITNESS: Yes, that is correct. At the beginning of the project, the company\n",
      "told us that they were going to pay us a one-time $125 to get there and come back,\n",
      "and they said that if we wanted to drive back and forth during the middle of the\n",
      "project, then that would be our own expense.\n",
      "(Id., pp.13:13-24, 18:6-18, 19:10-15.)\n",
      "Q. So looking at the payments made to David beginning June 1st of 2018, and going\n",
      "forward from there, he was working every week until he died; is that correct?\n",
      "A. Yes, from page 3 to 4, it shows him working 70 every week.\n",
      "Q. Now, I believe, Mr. Saragosa, that you testified when Ms. Hoffman was asking\n",
      "you questions that Bayview always had jobs going on around California; is that\n",
      "correct?\n",
      "A. Yes. Well, at that time, there were only new projects in Santa Monica, so the\n",
      "majority of the projects were in the Bay Area. There were a lot of projects going\n",
      "on, yes.\n",
      "(Id., pp. 21:22-22:7\n",

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "To address defendant's contention that the witness testimony shown in the trial transcript\n",
      "demonstrates that the commercial traveler rule is inapplicable, we examine whether applicant's\n",
      "activity at the time of his injury was one that defendant could \"reasonably expect to be incident to\n",
      "its requirement that [applicant] spend time away from home.\" (IBM Corp. v. Workers' Comp.\n",
      "Appeals Bd. (Korpela) (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 279, 283 [43 Cal.Comp.Cases 161].) In particular,\n",
      "we examine whether applicant's weekend travel was within the course of employment or a non-\n",
      "compensable \"distinct departure on a personal errand.\" (Korpela, supra, at p. 283.)\n",
      "Here, we previously found that the record shows that (1) defendant's employees who\n",
      "resided in the Bay Area and worked on its Santa Monica project would return to the Bay Area for\n",
      "a weekend or a Sunday; (2) defendant made lodging available for its employees based in the Bay\n",
      "Area without expecting the employees to stay in the lodging all seven nights of the week; (3)\n",
      "3\n",
      "applicant advised defendant that he would be traveling to the Bay Area on the morning of Saturday,\n",
      "July 28, 2018, after work on the Santa Monica project halted unexpectedly until the following\n",
      "Monday; and (4) defendant expected employees such as applicant who resided in the Bay Area to\n",
      "travel there during time off of their work on the Santa Monica project. (Opinion and Decision\n",
      "After Reconsideration, March 4, 2021, pp. 4-5.) Based upon this record, we concluded that\n",
      "applicant sustained injury while engaged in an activity which defendant reasonably expected to be\n",
      "incident to its requirement that he spend time away from home on its Santa Monica project—and\n",
      "not while engaged in a distinct departure from his employment. (Id.,\n",
      "p. 5.)\n",
      "As to the trial transcript, we note that defendant's supervisor, Mr. Saragosa, testified that\n",
      "employees residing in the Bay Area and working on the Santa Monica project were permitted to\n",
      "\"drive back and forth during the middle of the project,\" and that he was personally aware that\n",
      "applicant would stay in Santa Monica on some weekends and return to the Bay Area on others.\n",
      "(Reporter's Transcript of Hearing, August 4, 2020, p. 19:10-15; 26:4-13.)\n",
      "Thus, we are persuaded that the trial transcript provides additional evidence that applicant's\n",
      "injury occurred while he was engaged in travel which defendant reasonably expected to be incident\n",
      "to its requirement that he spend time away from his residence while working on its Santa Monica\n",
      "project and not while he was engaged in a distinct departure from his employment.\n",
      "Accordingly, we will affirm our Opinion and Decision After Reconsideration issued on\n",

      "Having determined the merits of the Petition, we nevertheless address applicant's requests\n",
      "to file a supplemental answer and to augment the record based upon newly discovered evidence in\n",
      "the form of transcripts of a May 27, 2021 deposition of defendant's director of operations, Peter\n",
      "Warren, and a April 6, 2021 deposition in a civil matter of defendant's supervisor, Juan Saragosa.\n",
      "In this regard, we observe that section 5906 provides, in pertinent part:\n",

      "of Mr. Ledesma and Mr. Saragosa.\n",
      "Mr. Saragosa was the Supervisor of a project to remove\n",

      "the workers on the project. . . [who] resided in the San Francisco\n",
      "Bay Area, and others were recruited from southern California.\n",
      "Neither Mr. Saragosa nor Mr. Ledesma was sure when the project\n",

      "five days a week, Monday through Friday. At some point, it was\n",
      "determined that insufficient progress was being made, and the\n",
      "employees were put on a six day a week work schedule.\n",
      "The employer provided the employees who were from the\n",
      "San Francisco Bay Area with a lump sum payment of $125.00 to\n",
      "cover one roundtrip from the Bay Area to Santa Monica. While the\n",
      "project was in process, the employer provided for lodging for the\n",
      "employees at a Motel 6. The lodging was available, and generally\n",
      "paid for, on a seven days per week basis. If a worker left the motel\n",
      "for a night or two, the employer notified the motel and asked for a\n",
      "rebate. The worker would have to re-register upon returning to the\n",

      "for a Sunday when they were working six days a week. On\n",

      "A \"commercial traveler is regarded as acting within the course of his\n",
      "employment during the entire period of his travel upon his employer's business.\"\n",
      "(Wiseman v. Industrial Acc. Comm. (1956) 46 Cal.2d 570, 572 [21\n",
      "Cal.Comp.Cases 192].) The Supreme Court has made clear that, “[i]n the case\n",
      "of a commercial traveler, workers' compensation coverage applies to the travel\n",
      "itself and also to other aspects of the trip reasonably necessary for the\n",
      "sustenance, comfort, and safety of the employee.\" (LaTourette v. Workers'\n",
      "Comp. Appeals Bd. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 644, 652 [63 Cal.Comp.Cases 253].) As\n",
      "the Court of Appeal observed, an employee away on business can “hardly [be]\n",
      "expected to remain holed up in his hotel room.\" (Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. v.\n",
      "Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (Moody) (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1316, 1327 [70\n",
      "Cal.Comp.Cases 1659].)\n",
      "The test is whether the activity during the injury is one “that an employer\n",
      "may reasonably expect to be incident to its requirement that an employee spend\n",
      "time away from home.\" (IBM Corp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (Korpela)\n",
      "(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 279, 283 [43 Cal.Comp.Cases 161].) This rule is\n",
      "construed liberally in favor of injured employees. (Korpela, supra, at p. 282\n",
      "(citing Labor Code section 3202).)\n",
      "In Korpela, the issue presented was whether an employee's death from an\n",
      "automobile accident while on a weekend trip to visit relatives during the course\n",
      "of an out-of-town training program was compensable under the commercial\n",
      "traveler rule. Evaluating whether the weekend trip was within the course of\n",
      "employment or a non-compensable \"distinct departure on a personal errand,” the\n",
      "court found that the weekend trip was a leisure time activity normally incident\n",
      "to an out-of-town temporary assignment, a conclusion further supported by the\n",
      "fact that the employee's supervisor knew of the visit and encouraged it.\n",
      "(Korpela, supra, at p. 283.)\n",
      "Similarly, in Hanford Cmty. Med. Ctr. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 81\n",

      "9\n",
      "of Appeal upheld the WCAB's finding that an employee's accidental death\n",
      "while traveling from his Fresno home to attend the second day of an off-site\n",
      "conference in Pismo Beach after having departed the conference the previous\n",
      "day to be home with his daughter who had just given birth was compensable\n",
      "under the \"commercial traveler\" doctrine. (See Skubitz v. Hanford Community\n",
      "Hosp., 2016 Cal. Wrk. Comp. P.D. LEXIS 168, pp. 18-20.)\n",
      "Here, as stated by the Report, the record shows that defendant's workers\n",
      "who resided in the Bay Area and worked on its project in Santa Monica would\n",
      "return to the Bay Area for a weekend or a Sunday. (Report, p. 4.) Defendant's\n",
      "supervisor, Mr. Saragosa, testified that he himself returned to the Bay Area\n",
      "approximately five or six times during the duration of the project. (Id.)\n",
      "Further, defendant made lodging available for its employees based in the\n",
      "Bay Area without expecting the employees to stay in the lodging all seven nights\n",
      "of the week. (See Id., pp. 3-4.) In particular, defendant would seek a rebate\n",
      "whenever an employee chose not to stay in the lodging for one or two nights.\n",
      "(Id., p. 4.)\n",
      "Further, applicant advised defendant that he would be traveling to the Bay\n",
      "Area on the morning of Saturday, July 28, 2018, after work on the project came\n",
      "to an unexpected halt until the following Monday. (Id., p. 4.)\n",
      "Thus, the record reveals that applicant's travel to the Bay Area during his\n",
      "time off was a practice which defendant expected of its employees; and, more\n",
      "specifically, that defendant's supervisor knew of applicant's travel on the\n",
      "weekend of his death. (Report, pp. 4, 7.) Notably, defendant's supervisor did\n",
      "not object to applicant's travel as a deviation from his employment, but merely\n",
      "cautioned him as a \"friend\" that the travel would be tiring. (Id., p. 7.) It follows\n",
      "that applicant sustained injury while engaged in an activity which defendant\n",
      "reasonably expected to be incident to its requirement that applicant spend time\n",
      "away from home on its Santa Monica project and not while engaged in a\n",

      "407 [33 Cal.Comp.Cases 647].)\n",
      "Here, our review of the medical evidence clearly indicates that the doctors' reports are\n",
      "inconsistent as to the issue of applicant's disability status, and the doctors did not explain the basis\n",
      "for their varying opinions. For example, in her initial report QME Dr. Ryan stated that applicant\n",
      "had reached maximum medical improvement/permanent and stationary status, she assigned\n",
      "percentages of WPI for the various injured body parts, and addressed the issue of apportionment.\n",
      "(See App. Exh. 2, pp. 64 – 79.) After re-examining applicant, Dr. Ryan reiterated her opinion that\n",
      "applicant's condition was permanent and stationary (App. Exh. 3, p. 55) but in her subsequent\n",
      "report she said it was a \"typographical error\" and that applicant was \"not at a permanent and\n",
      "stationary/maximal medical improvement level.\" (App. Exh. 4, p. 10.) Having discussed her\n",
      "opinions regarding impairment and apportionment, Dr. Ryan had clearly previously determined\n",
      "that applicant's condition was permanent and stationary and had reached maximum medical\n",
      "improvement. However, she did not explain the basis for changing her opinion as stated in her\n",
      "October 28, 2020 report. (App. Exh. 4, p. 10.) Also, the treating doctor reports do not explain why\n",
      "applicant's condition was permanent stationary as of December 20, 2018, but applicant was\n",
      "temporarily totally disabled from October 22, 2020, through December 4, 2020.\n",
      "Due to the inconsistencies in the doctors' reports as discussed herein, we are unable to\n",
      "determine for what period or periods applicant was temporarily totally disabled as a result of the\n",
      "March 5, 2018 industrial injury.\n",
      "The Appeals Board has the discretionary authority to develop the record when the medical\n",
      "record is not substantial evidence or where there is insufficient evidence to determine an issue.\n",

      "Finally, it is important to note that the issue of whether applicant's employment was\n",

      "temporary disability after the date of the termination (July 15, 2019; see Joint Exh. AA). Although\n",
      "we are not making any determination as to the issue of the termination of applicant's employment,\n",

      "We note that pursuant to Labor Code³ section 5909, a petition for reconsideration is\n",
      "generally considered denied by operation of law if the Appeals Board does not act on the petition\n",
      "within 60 days of filing. (Lab. Code, § 5909.) However, “it is a fundamental principle of due\n",
      "process that a party may not be deprived of a substantial right without notice (Shipley v.\n",
      "Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1104, 1108 [57 Cal.Comp.Cases 493].) In\n",
      "Shipley, the Appeals Board denied the applicant's petition reconsideration because the Appeals\n",
      "Board had not acted on the petition within the statutory time limits of section 5909. (Lab. Code,\n",
      "§ 5909.) This occurred because the Appeals Board had misplaced the file, through no fault of the\n",
      "parties. The Court of Appeal reversed the Appeals Board's decision, holding that the time to act\n",
      "on applicant's petition was tolled during the period that the file was misplaced. (Shipley, supra, at\n",
      "1108.) Like the Court in Shipley, \"we are not convinced that the burden of the system's\n",
      "inadequacies should fall on [a party].\" In this case, the Appeals Board failed to act on applicant's\n",
      "Petition within 60 days of its filing on August 11, 2021, through no fault of the parties. Therefore,\n",
      "considering that the Appeals Board's failure to act on the Petition was in error we find that our\n",

      "necessary elements of a contract must exist, including an offer of settlement of a disputed claim\n",
      "by one of the parties, and an acceptance by the other. (Id.) There can be no contract unless there is\n",
      "a meeting of the minds and the parties mutually agree upon the same thing. (Civ. Code, §§ 1550,\n",
      "1565, 1580; Sackett v. Starr (1949) 95 Cal.App.2d 128; Sieck v. Hall (1934) 139 Cal.App.279,\n",
      "291; American Can Co. v. Agricultural Ins. Co. (1909) 12 Cal.App. 133, 137.) Stipulations\n",

      "It is from this Findings and Award that petitioner seeks reconsideration.\n",
      "III\n",
      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "Labor Code §4660(a) states that \"in determining the percentages of permanent\n",
      "disability, account shall be taken of the nature of the physical injury or\n",
      "disfigurement, the occupation of the injured employee, and his or her age at the\n",
      "time of the injury, consideration being given to an employee's diminished future\n",
      "earning capacity\". The scheduled rating is 'prima facie evidence of the\n",
      "percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to each injury covered by the\n",
      "schedule'. (Labor Code §4660(c).)\n",
      "In Oglivie, the Court of Appeals held that there are three permissible methods\n",
      "by which the schedule rating could be rebutted. (Oglivie v. Workers' Comp.\n",
      "Appeals Bd. (2011) 197 Cal. App. 4th.) The primary method for rebutting the\n",
      "scheduled rating is based upon a determination that the injured worker is not\n",
      "amendable to rehabilitation and, for that reason, the employee's diminished\n",
      "future earning capacity is greater than reflected in the scheduled rating. The\n",
      "employee's diminished future earnings must be directly attributable to the\n",
      "employee's work-related injury and not due to nonindustrial factors such as\n",
      "general economic conditions, illiteracy, proficiency in spealdng English, or an\n",
      "employee's lack of education. (Ogilvie, 197 Cal. App. 4th.)\n",
      "5\n",
      "In Dahl, the Court of Appeal held that to rebut the scheduled rating, applicant\n",
      "must prove that the industrial injury precludes vocational rehabilitation, writing\n",
      "in salient\n",
      "part as follows:\n",
      "The first step in any LeBoeuf analysis is to determine whether a\n",
      "work-related injury precludes the claimant from taking advantage of\n",
      "vocational rehabilitation and participating in the labor force. This\n",
      "necessarily requires an individualized approach. It is this\n",
      "individualized assessment of whether industrial factors preclude the\n",
      "employee's rehabilitation that Ogilvie approved as a method for\n",
      "rebutting the schedule. (Dahl, 80 Cal. Comp. Cases at 1128,)\n",
      "Here, the court relied on the vocational evidence from Mr. Greenberg to\n",
      "determine that the applicant is not amenable to vocational rehabilitation and the\n",
      "medical work restrictions preclude full time employment. The comprehensive\n",
      "vocational assessment offered by Mr. Greenberg relies upon his own objective\n",
      "testing, substantial medical evidence, and an individualized valuation of the\n",
      "applicant's employability to effectively rebut the scheduled rating.\n",
      "Oddly, petitioner seeks to discount the medical work restrictions imposed by the\n",
      "AME, Dr. Zwerin that served as the basis for Mr. Greenberg's opinion. Petitioner\n",
      "states, \"Greenberg attempts to return us to the 1997 rating schedule which was\n",
      "based on work restrictions.\" (Petition, p.21, lines 8-9.)\n",
      "This court disagrees. Here, Dr. Zwerin initially issued a whole person\n",
      "impairment rating consistent with the AMA Guides and the 2005 Permanent\n",
      "Disability Rating Schedule (PDRS). Upon request by Mr. Greenberg, Dr.\n",
      "Zwerin merely clarified the work restrictions he had previously imposed. Of\n",
      "course, as a part of their reporting requirements, QME's are obligated to offer an\n",
      "opinion as to the nature, extent and duration of disability and work limitations,\n",
      "if any. (CCR §10606(b)(8).)\n",
      "Petitioner repeatedly alleges that 'a finding of 100% permanent and total\n",
      "disability would be inappropriate due to a medical-legal finding of 15%\n",
      "apportionment to non-industrial factors.\" (Petition p. 8, lines 25-26.)\n",
      "Primarily, it is important to note that Dr. Zwerin's finding of 15% apportionment\n",
      "was considered valid and factored into the court's determination of permanent\n",
      "disability under the 2005 PDRS. After apportionment, there was a rebuttable\n",
      "scheduled rating of 54% based on the AME's opinion. (Opinion on Decision, p.\n",
      "1, 4/6/22.)\n",
      "At this point, defendant's argument becomes flawed. The permanent and total\n",
      "disability award was based on a finding that the scheduled rating was rebutted\n",
      "6\n",
      "pursuant to Oglivie and its progeny. According to the substantial vocational\n",
      "evidence in the record, the applicant is permanently and totally disabled and\n",
      "unable to compete in the open labor market solely as a result of his industrial\n",
      "injury.\n",
      "Petitioner asserts, without basis, that Mr. Greenberg's report fails to properly\n",
      "take into account Dr. Zwerin's findings on apportionment. (Petition, p. 20, line\n",
      "22-23.) This clearly misrepresents the record. In his report of July 30, 2021, Mr.\n",
      "Greenberg specifically states:\n",
      "\"While a 15% apportionment to non-industrial factors (CP), it is my\n",
      "opinion that the limitations that resulted from the on-the-job injury\n",
      "would prevent Mr. Helper from being employed. While there is a\n",
      "15% non-industrial affect, it should be noted that Mr. Helper was\n",
      "able to be successfully employed with the County of Sonoma. His\n",
      "non-industrial condition did not affect his ability to perform the\n",
      "Drug & Alcohol Counseling position.\"\n",
      "(App. Exh. 1, Mr. Greenberg, 7/30/21.)\n",
      "Of course, Mr. Greenberg, as a vocational expert, is not required to blindly adopt\n",
      "and apply the apportionment opinion of the AME Dr. Zwerin. A vocational\n",
      "expert is not guilty of ignoring a medical opinion simply because it is not\n",
      "followed. As here, it is only required that the vocational report include the\n",
      "injured employee's medical history, including injuries and conditions and\n",
      "residuals thereof, and the reasons behind the vocational opinion. (CCR\n",
      "§10685(c).)\n",
      "Based on this record, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that the\n",
      "applicant is 100% permanently disabled. Petitioner's alleged flaws do not\n",
      "weaken the evidentiary weight of Mr. Greenberg's opinions. The opinion of Mr.\n",
      "Greenberg is substantial and support a finding of permanent total disability.\n",
      "Contrary to petitioner's assertions, Ms. Moeller's opinions are not persuasive and\n",
      "fail to impeach the conclusions of Mr. Greenberg. (Petition, p. 22, line 11.) After\n",
      "considering the record as a whole, Ms. Moeller offers an overly simplified and\n",
      "abridged depiction of applicant's physical limitations.\n",
      "It is well established that a vocational expert's report can support an award only\n",
      "if it is found to be substantial evidence. Where the evaluating physicians do not\n",
      "conclude that an injured employee is permanently and totally disabled, an\n",

      "work. (Jt. Exh. JI, Dr. Zwerin, 11/15/21.) This automatically would eliminate\n",

      "In the Findings and Award of September 30, 2019, the Workers' Compensation Judge\n",
      "(WCJ) issued findings in two case numbers.\n",
      "In ADJ946031, the WCJ found that on November 2, 1994, applicant, while employed as a\n",
      "courier by National Courier Systems, then insured by Superior National Insurance, in liquidation\n",

      "In ADJ3762315, the WCJ found that on May 4, 1999, applicant, while employed as a\n",
      "control parking technician by the City of Oakland, sustained industrial injury to her lumbar spine,\n",
      "bilateral shoulders, bilateral knees, bilateral wrists, right elbow, bilateral arms, right ankle, and left\n",
      "foot, and that applicant's earnings at the time of injury were $514.41 per week, warranting\n",
      "temporary disability indemnity payable at the rate of $342.94 per week and the \"statutory\n",
      "maximum for permanent disability.\" In ADJ3762315, the WCJ also found that the correct rate of\n",
      "payment of temporary total disability indemnity is $449.28 per week, and that temporary disability\n",
      "benefits are payable at the weekly rate of $449.28 for any temporary disability paid two years after\n",
      "the date of injury with the City of Oakland. In addition, the WCJ found that \"as a result of all of\n",
      "applicant's alleged dates of injuries, applicant is 100% permanently totally disabled without\n",
      "apportionment.\"\n",
      "In the Findings and Award of September 30, 2019, the WCJ also issued a Joint Award,\n",

      "opinion of Dr. Mandell, the Agreed Medical Evaluator (AME) in orthopedics, who apportioned\n",
      "liability to three separate and distinct injuries, and to non-industrial causes. Petitioner further\n",
      "contends that the WCJ erred in relying on a single document to increase applicant's temporary\n",
      "disability rate for all payments after 2001, that the document is not substantial evidence because it\n",
      "included the range of pay for applicant's position eighteen years after the time of injury, and that\n",
      "the parties limited the time period in dispute to a single year.\n",
      "Applicant filed an answer.\n",
      "The WCJ submitted a Report and Recommendation (“Report”).\n",
      "We begin by noting that in her Report, the WCJ states in relevant part, “it would be in the\n",
      "benefit of all parties to return this matter for further development of the record both on the issue\n",
      "of correct earnings as well as on the issue [of] apportionment.\" Based on our review of the record,\n",
      "we agree with the WCJ's recommendation as just stated. However, we do not adopt or incorporate\n",
      "the WCJ's Report because it is skeletal and not in compliance with WCAB Rule 10962. (Cal.\n",
      "Code Regs., tit. 8, § 10962.)\n",
      "We further note that in reference to the issue of earnings, the WCJ stated in her Opinion on\n",
      "Decision, \"applicant should have been paid temporary disability benefits at $449.28 for any\n",
      "temporary disability paid after May 4, 2001.\" The WCJ further stated that this determination was\n",
      "\"based on the documentary evidence presented by applicant,” but the WCJ did not otherwise\n",
      "specify the evidence she relied upon. As a result, we are prevented from ascertaining the basis for\n",
      "the WCJ's determination of the temporary disability indemnity rate. (See Evans v. Workmen's\n",
      "2\n",
      "Comp. Appeals Bd. (1968) 68 Cal.2d 753, 755 (33 Cal.Comp.Cases 350, 351): [The WCJ's\n",
      "Opinion on Decision \"enables the parties, and the Board if reconsideration is sought, to ascertain\n",
      "the basis for the decision, and makes the right of seeking reconsideration more meaningful.”].)\n",
      "For this reason, and in view of the WCJ's admission in her Report that the record requires further\n",
      "development on the issue of earnings, we will rescind the WCJ's finding on this issue and return\n",
      "this matter to the trial level for further proceedings and new finding on the issues of earnings and\n",
      "the temporary disability indemnity rate.\n",
      "Turning to the issues of permanent disability and apportionment, the Minutes of Hearing\n",
      "of August 1, 2019 reflect that the parties stipulated, as to the specific injury of November 2, 1994\n",
      "(ADJ946031), that “applicant's overall permanent disability is 100 percent prior to\n",
      "apportionment,\" with the issues of permanent disability and apportionment being raised in both\n",
      "case numbers. Thus, applicant's permanent and total disability may be subject to apportionment\n",
      "in two ways: (1) between the two industrial injuries; and (2) to non-industrial \"other factors\" under\n",
      "Labor Code section 4663.\n",
      "We also note that the WCJ's Opinion on Decision includes some confusing statements on\n",
      "permanent disability and apportionment. Referring to the two specific industrial injuries, the WCJ\n",
      "states, “[i]t is because of all of the injuries combined that applicant is 100% totally temporarily\n",
      "disabled on a permanent basis.\" (Italics added.) Referring to Dr. Mandell's opinion on\n",
      "apportionment, the WCJ then states, “[s]ince it is the synergistic effect of all body parts injured\n",
      "that caused applicant's total disability, apportioning each body part separately [as attempted by\n",
      "Dr. Mandell] does not calculate.\" In the former statement, the WCJ seems to confuse temporary\n",
      "and permanent disability, while referring to the combined effects of applicant's injuries. In the\n",
      "latter statement, the WCJ refers to the synergistic effects of the injured body parts as a reason for\n",
      "rejecting Dr. Mandell's apportionment. However, this may not be a valid reason for disallowing\n",
      "apportionment if the combined injuries resulted in permanent and total disability, per the WCJ's\n",
      "former statement referred to above. We conclude the WCJ must revisit and clarify her approach\n",
      "to resolving the issue of apportionment in both case numbers.\n",
      "In addition, we note the WCJ's Opinion on Decision disallows apportionment based on\n",
      "non-industrial factors, and between the two injuries. At the same time, it appears the WCJ issued\n",
      "a joint Award against both employers, National Courier Systems and the City of Oakland, but\n",
      "without apportioning liability between them. This is contrary to Benson v. Workers' Comp.\n",
      "3\n",
      "Appeals Bd. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1535 [74 Cal.Comp.Cases 113]. In Benson, the Court of\n",
      "Appeal concluded that pursuant to Senate Bill 899 enacted in 2004, the law of apportionment\n",
      "mandates that multiple injuries ordinarily require separate permanent disability awards. However,\n",
      "the Court also stated that \"there may be limited circumstances...when the evaluating physician\n",
      "cannot parcel out, with reasonable medical probability, the approximate percentages to which each\n",
      "distinct industrial injury causally contributed to the employee's overall permanent disability. In\n",
      "such limited circumstances, when the employer has failed to meet its burden of proof, a combined\n",
      "award of permanent disability may still be justified.\" (170 Cal.App.4th at 1560.)\n",
      "In this case, the WCJ rejected apportionment between injuries notwithstanding Dr.\n",
      "Mandell's having done so in his deposition. (Joint Exhibit 102, pp. 21-26.) Further, the WCJ\n",
      "applied the \"Benson exception\" (physician cannot parcel out causation percentages for each injury)\n",
      "without citing to Benson and without citing evidence demonstrating that the effects of applicant's\n",
      "two industrial injuries are “inextricably intertwined.\" (See Power v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd.\n",
      "(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 775, 782 (51 Cal.Comp.Cases 114) [AME's opinion ordinarily is followed\n",
      "because the AME has been chosen by the parties for the AME's expertise and neutrality.].)\n",
      "Accordingly, we conclude that the WCJ must revisit the issue of apportionment to resolve\n",
      "the outstanding questions discussed above. As suggested in the WCJ's Report, she may further\n",
      "develop the medical record on the issue of apportionment as she deems necessary or appropriate.\n",

      "In the case of officers and employees in the Department of Corrections having\n",
      "custodial duties ... the term “injury\" includes heart trouble which develops or\n",
      "manifests itself during a period while such officer or employee is in the service\n",

      "is disputable and may be controverted by other evidence, but unless so\n",
      "controverted, the appeals board is bound to find in accordance with it. This\n",
      "presumption shall be extended to a member following termination of service for\n",

      "not to exceed 60 months in any circumstance, commencing with the last date\n",

      "5\n",
      "A. We have no idea exactly how many rags that Mr. Oakes picked up and\n",
      "brought back to the shop after brakes were wiped, actually contained asbestos.\n",
      "But I think it is a safe bet that over this period of years, when he was picking up\n",

      "them. He breathed in the asbestos fibers, and that is how he ended up with\n",

      "necessary to contribute to the mesothelioma?\n",
      "A. You know, I don't think I have any scientific way of answering that question.\n",

      "A. Well, I think any exposure to asbestos above background exposure would be\n",
      "thought of in this case as being causal for his malignant mesothelioma.\n",

      "picked them up? Would that be sufficient exposure?\n",
      "A. I don't think there is any scientific way to answer that question. I think we\n",
      "would be speculating. I mean, I think the guy I think the guy picked up rags\n",
      "that had asbestos on them. I don't know if he did it every day, twice a day, once\n",
      "a month, every day except Sunday. I don't know. All I know is what it says here\n",

      "throw them in a corner or a box or a pail, and Mr. Oakes would have to go pick\n",

      "of his exposure, at least at this time?\n",

      "much as an insulator or a pipefitter, but I think he was exposed to asbestos over\n",

      "432 [84 Cal.Comp.Cases 1033]. However, regarding the underlying facts in that case, the Court\n",

      "submitted the Petition and Answer at issue herein. We have no evidence of the actual costs incurred\n",
      "by the parties as a result of this matter, but there clearly is a question as to whether the $118.44\n",

      "sufficient to assign a DRE category II whole person impairment of 8% (Defense\n",

      "of 12/4/19, Petitioner did not mention that he had a preexisting back injury (Page\n",
      "7, lines 1-25, page 8 lines 1-4). Dr. Fonseca agreed that Petitioner has a\n",

      "Petitioner testified that he did not have any symptoms in his low back prior to\n",

      "he never had a low back injury prior to working there (SOE, page 2, lines 9-11).\n",
      "He also testified that he did not have back pain as a result of his injury in 2011,\n",
      "but after being confronted with the reporting of Dr. Silver who evaluated him\n",
      "for the 2011 injury, he admitted that he had low back pain at that time (SOE,\n",
      "page 2, lines 14-19). Petitioner's supervisor Rossana Harris testified that\n",
      "contrary to Petitioner's testimony, she did not rub Petitioner's back using a\n",
      "folding chair. She also testified that Petitioner told her that his back pain was\n",
      "from a prior injury (SOE, page 3, lines 7-9).\n",
      "The Court issued a Joint Findings and Take Nothing Order on 4/6/22\n",
      "wherein it was determined that Petitioner did not sustain injury AOE/COE. The\n",
      "basis for the decision was that Petitioner did not meet his burden due to a lack\n",
      "of substantial evidence as well as Petitioner's highly questionable credibility.\n",

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "LACK OF SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE\n",
      "Labor Code section 5705 states that \"The burden of proof rests upon the\n",
      "party or lien claimant holding the affirmative of the issue.\" It is the employee's\n",
      "burden to provide substantial medical evidence to establish industrial causation.¹\n",
      "Petitioner admits that there is no such evidence, and as such ostensibly admits\n",
      "that he didn't meet his burden.\n",
      "Contrary to Petitioner's assertion, the Court did not rely on any medical\n",
      "evidence in its determination. The determination was made based on a lack of\n",
      "substantial evidence to support Petitioner's burden of proof.\n",
      "Petitioner appears to argue that substantial evidence exists in the form of\n",
      "reports from Dr. Fonseca. But those reports were not offered into evidence. It\n",
      "appears that the report dated 8/27/20 was obtained after the closure of discovery,\n",
      "but again, it was not offered into evidence.\n",
      "DUTY TO DEVELOP THE RECORD\n",
      "Although it is well settled that the Court has a duty to develop the medical\n",
      "record when there is no substantial evidence on which a decision can be based,\n",
      "it has also been held that the duty to develop the medical record should not be\n",

      "a claim.² In this case, Applicant failed to tell either of the examining physicians\n",
      "in this case about his prior back injury in 2011. Additionally, Applicant denied\n",
      "any such injury at the time of trial until he was confronted with said records.\n",
      "Thus, this is exactly the type of situation where it would be improper to develop\n",
      "the medical record to rescue the Applicant.\n",
      "Petitioner has asserted that the Court declined to review Dr. Fonseca's\n",

      "Dr. Fonseca in crafting its determination. Petitioner is correct. The Court cannot\n",
      "consider documents that are not part of the evidentiary record. Dr. Fonseca's\n",
      "reports were not offered. It is unknown why Petitioner did not offer said reports\n",
      "into evidence. It could have been an oversight on Petitioner's part. In any event,\n",
      "the failure of Petition to offer Dr. Fonseca's original QME report into evidence\n",
      "is not significant considering he deferred his opinion to the trier of fact when his\n",
      "deposition was taken. Based on the evidentiary record as presented by the\n",
      "parties, there is no substantial evidence of industrial causation. Dr. Haronian's\n",
      "opinion was based on a substantially false and inaccurate medical history³, and\n",
      "Dr. Fonseca deferred his opinion to the trier of fact.\n",
      "APPLICANT’S TESTIMONY\n",
      "Petitioner argues that the Court must accept Applicant's unrebutted\n",
      "testimony. Of course that is false. If Applicant's testimony is not credible, then\n",
      "it doesn't matter if it is unrebutted. In this case, the Court opined that Petitioner\n",
      "had highly questionable credibility due to the fact that he failed to disclose his\n",
      "prior back injury to either examining physician in this case, and initially denied\n",
      "such injury under oath until confronted with the records of same.\n",
      "Additionally, Petitioner's argument is not valid because his testimony was\n",
      "in fact rebutted by Defense witness Rossana Harris. Ms. Harris denied that\n",
      "rubbing Petitioner's back with a folding chair. She also testified that Petitioner\n",
      "attributed his back pain to a prior injury and that he never reported any type of\n",
      "aggravation of his pre-existing back pain due to the hand massage she provided\n",

      "Applicant pled a psychiatric/stress claim. (Minutes of Hearing/Summary\n",
      "of Evidence \"MOH/SOE” at p. 2). The claim is denied. (Defendant Exhibit\n",
      "\"A\"). This claim stems from several events at work that led to Applicant's\n",
      "psychiatric injury to wit: 1) denial of a promotion to HR Analyst IV in 2016; 2)\n",
      "being characterized as racist at work; 3) a negative performance evaluation; and\n",
      "4) failure to secure a promotion to Assistant Administrator. The latter of these\n",
      "three events all occurred subsequent to what became known as the\n",
      "'whistleblowing letter' discussed infra.\n",
      "At trial, Applicant testified that he was hired in September of 2009.\n",
      "(MOH/SOE at p. 4:6-7). The parties stipulated that Applicant was employed\n",
      "during the period September 21, 2009 to February 12, 2020, by County of Los\n",
      "Angeles, Department of Regional Planning. (Id. at p. 2:6-8). Applicant testified\n",
      "that his psychiatric injury began in approximately 2017 after he was passed over\n",
      "for a position.¹ (Id. at 4:9-16). The position was offered to Ms. Hayward even\n",
      "though he had scored higher on the exam. Id. He also testified that Ms. Hayward\n",
      "obtained the position even before the examination. (Id. at p. 4:17-18). His\n",
      "supervisor at the time, Robert Meyers, informed him that Ms. Hayward would\n",
      "be promoted even if she had not taken the exam. (Applicant Exhibit 1, at p. 4).\n",
      "After this event, he had difficulty sleeping, felt doomed, stressed, and unable to\n",
      "focus at work. (Id. at p. 5:13-14). Next, he testified that he attended a regional\n",
      "planning meeting and felt uncomfortable with some of the proposed\n",
      "1 Although the position was not described during testimony, based on review of the records, the undersigned notes\n",
      "the position in question was for HR Analyst IV.\n",
      "3\n",
      "management practices. (Id. at p. 5:19-20). Mark Ridley Thomas was being\n",
      "termed out of political office and each department was asked to hire two to three\n",
      "of his staff contrary to civil service rules. (Id. at p. 5:20-22). Applicant and other\n",
      "managers objected to the hiring of political appointees since it undermines the\n",
      "civil service system. (Id. at p. 5:23-25).\n",
      "After this meeting, he sent a letter to the Director of Personnel, Mr. Larson,\n",
      "and his supervisor, Joseph Horvath, explaining why this hiring process was\n",
      "unfair and weakened the culture of fair play. (Id. at p. 6:6-9).² At about the time\n",
      "of the whistleblowing incident, Applicant was interested in a position for\n",
      "Assistant Administrator that was ranked at a higher salary level. (Id. at p. 6:10-\n",
      "12). He believes that after the whistleblowing letter, he lost the support of his\n",
      "supervisor, Mr. Horvath, for this position. Mr. Horvath told him that the CEO\n",
      "yelled, that the Director of the Department, Amy Bodeck, was angry and would\n",
      "not support a manager who did not take the county's position. (Id. at p. 6:12-17).\n",
      "He was also informed that the letter was construed as racially motivated. (Id.).\n",
      "He met with Dennis Loven, a deputy director, who tried to convince him\n",
      "that he had no whistleblower protection, and shared with Applicant an\n",
      "experience of someone else who went contrary to the department and was fired.\n",
      "(Id. at p. 7:16-23). He also testified to another meeting with Rodney Collins\n",
      "(manager over multiple divisions) and Michael Stewart (Principal Analyst for\n",
      "the Civil Service Advocacy Division) wherein Mr. Collins explained that he too\n",
      "was a political appointee and a good worker and that while Applicant's letter\n",
      "itself may not have been racially motivated, that there were other instances of\n",
      "racial conduct. (Id. at p. 8:1-6).\n",
      "At trial, the only rebuttal evidence was that of Mr. Horvath who testified\n",
      "that the Assistant Administrator position has always been open and was used for\n",
      "budget purposes. (Id. at p. 10:1-4). He also testified that other departments are\n",
      "not fans of the process of hiring political appointees because he has heard other\n",
      "people vent, (Id. at p. 10:15-17) but that this hiring practice is outside his\n",
      "purview. (Id. at 20-22). Upon probing by the court, Mr. Horvath testified\n",
      "generally about the hiring practices and civil service rules. (Id. at p. 12: 2-21).\n",
      "Applicant saw QME, Dr. Lou Ellen Sherrill, who issued two reports.\n",
      "(Defendant Exhibit “B & C”). Dr. Sherrill was deposed on January 22, 2021.\n",
      "(Joint Exhibit \"T\"). Dr. Marc Nehorayan also issued a report of February 16,\n",
      "2021. (Applicant Exhibit “1”).\n",
      "Dr. Sherrill's reports did not take an accurate or complete account of the\n",
      "events occurring at work that precipitated this claim. The majority of\n",
      "Applicant's history obtained by Dr. Sherrill was through a psychological history\n",
      "questionnaire. (Defendant Exhibit “B”, at p. 2, 5, 7, 8; see also Defendant\n",
      "Exhibit C, at p. 16). Applicant testified that Dr. Sherrill did not ask about his\n",
      "2 This letter ultimately became known as the 'whistleblowing' letter.\n",
      "4\n",
      "history and did not want to hear about events prior to when he went out on leave.\n",
      "(MOH/SOE at p. 8:11-13). Related to her battery of tests, Dr. Sherrill found that\n",
      "Applicant has a long-standing personality disorder (likely beginning in\n",
      "adolescence) associated with his perceptions that he works in a hostile work\n",
      "environment. (Defendant Exhibit “B”, at p. 34). She discounted the few events\n",
      "relayed by the Applicant about his experiences at work indicating that she had\n",
      "no evidence to support the events. For example, she wrote “there are no\n",
      "personnel records to explain why the Applicant did not receive the promotion he\n",
      "sought.” Id. at p. 9; “I have received no records or any evidence that proves\n",
      "allegations that a stressful work environment caused the Applicant to experience\n",
      "symptoms of stress.\" Id. at p. 30; \"I have received no records or any evidence\n",
      "that provide the Applicant had a justifiable reason to be fearful of retaliatory\n",
      "actions by County and Regional Planning Management.” Id. at p. 31; \"I have no\n",
      "records that prove that his work environment is hostile.\" (Defendant Exhibit\n",
      "\"C\", at p. 31). In numerous sections of her reports and in cross-examination, she\n",
      "indicated that if Applicant was being treated unfairly, he should simply have\n",
      "searched for another job where he was valued. Dr. Sherill reviewed records of\n",
      "Applicant's treating physician with Southern California Mental health\n",
      "Associates, Dr. David Kauss.³ (Defendant Exhibit “B”, at p. 21:28-30).\n",
      "Dr. Nehorayan disagreed with Dr. Sherrill's opinion and found that a\n",
      "predominant cause of Applicant's psychiatric injury was related to his\n",
      "employment, specifically, four events assigned as follows:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Event 1 (55%) denial of promotion in 2016 to Human Resources Analyst\n",
      "IV.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Event 2 (15%) defamation of character being identified as racist.\n",
      "Event 3 (10%) negative work evaluation in February 2020.\n",
      "Event 4 (10%) non-promotion to position of Assistant Administrator.\n",
      "He attributed the remaining 10% to non-industrial causes.\n",
      "III\n",
      "DISCUSSION:\n",
      "Defendant filed a Petition for Reconsideration arguing that: 1) the\n",
      "evidence does not justify the findings of psychiatric injury on an industrial basis;\n",
      "2) Defendant met its burden of proof of a lawful, non-discriminatory, good faith\n",
      "personnel action pursuant to Labor Code section 3208.3(h); and 3) permanent\n",
      "disability, apportionment and attorney fees should not be awarded on the current\n",
      "findings. While these three items are listed as the crux of the issues presented,\n",
      "the Petition is replete with various other arguments that the undersigned\n",
      "addresses within each section infra.\n",
      "3 Dr. Kauss was a treating physician and found that “actual events of employment clearly are predominant as to all\n",
      "causes combined of the psychiatric injury.\" (Applicant Exhibit \"2\", at p. 20).\n",
      "5\n",
      "I.\n",
      "THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE FINDINGS OF\n",
      "FACT\n",
      "Defendant raised two issues in this regard (a) there was no objective\n",
      "evidence to support a finding of industrial injury;4 (b) Applicant provided\n",
      "inaccurate and inconsistent histories to the various doctors; and (c) Event #1\n",
      "should be excluded based on the statute of limitation. It should be noted that\n",
      "while not argued at any length, Defendant states that Applicant began\n",
      "employment with Department of Regional Planning in 2018.5\n",
      "a. Objective Evidence\n",
      "Defendant argues that Applicant did not provide any objective evidence\n",
      "of harassment, persecution, or defamation for the alleged psychiatric injury\n",
      "relying on Verga v. WCAB, 73 Cal. Comp. Cases 63. In Verga, the issue before\n",
      "the court was whether the disdainful reactions of a supervisor and co-workers to\n",
      "an employee's mistreatment of them constituted actual events of employment.\n",
      "Id. at 64. The evidence at trial showed that the applicant was a difficult person\n",
      "to get along with, impolite, and unpleasant. Id. The court noted that Labor Code\n",
      "section 3208.3 subdivision (b)(1) was enacted to set a higher threshold of\n",
      "compensability for psychiatric injury and that the Legislature disapproved a\n",
      "ruling permitting such benefits based on an employee's subjective misperception\n",
      "that the employment was stressful. Id. at 64-65. This change “in the statutory\n",
      "scheme constituted an intent to require the claimant to establish objective\n",
      "evidence of harassment, persecution, or other such basis for alleged psychiatric\n",
      "injury.\" Id. at 65. In Verga, the court relied largely on testimonial evidence\n",
      "from several witnesses that the applicant was a very difficult employee and\n",
      "upheld the WCJ's finding that the applicant was not actually subject to\n",
      "harassment or persecution, Id. at 69, but rather misperceived as harassment her\n",
      "co-workers' disdainful response to her mistreatment of them. Id.\n",
      "The question thus presented is the definition of objective evidence.\n",
      "Objective evidence refers to evidence that can be externally verified. Objective\n",
      "evidence is not synonymous with tangible evidence. Applicant testified credibly\n",
      "to Events 1, 2, and 4. These Events could be externally verified and Defendant\n",
      "should have presented testimony to rebut Applicant's testimony. It is also noted\n",
      "that at no point did Defendant raise the issue of the validity as to the Events\n",
      "occurring during cross-examination. Instead, Defendant argued at trial and\n",
      "continues to argue in its Petition for Reconsideration that these Events were good\n",
      "faith personnel actions. This case is not like Verga, there is no evidence to\n",
      "4 This issue was summarized under the section \"Argument with Points and Authority\" in Defendant's Petition for\n",
      "Reconsideration.\n",
      "5 The parties stipulated at trial that Applicant was employed by the Department of Regional Planning beginning in\n",
      "2009 as discuss supra. Any efforts to rebut his time in this department should have been raised at the time of trial.\n",
      "Further, even if Applicant changed departments through his employment, the employer remained the same.\n",
      "6\n",
      "suggest that the events of workplace were a result of the Applicant's honest\n",
      "misperception.\n",
      "Objective evidence can also consists of medical records or expert opinion.\n",
      "Objective medical evidence is evidence based on objective symptoms within the\n",
      "knowledge of a doctor in that they are perceptible to persons other than the\n",
      "patient. Here, there is objective medical evidence by both Dr. Kauss and Dr.\n",
      "Nehorayan through medical evaluations and an extensive battery of tests finding\n",
      "that actual events of employment were the substantial cause of Applicant's\n",
      "injury. Therefore, the undersigned finds that Applicant's credible testimony,\n",
      "lack of rebuttal thereof, and medical evidence support that injury was caused by\n",
      "actual events of employment.\n",
      "b. Inaccurate and Inconsistent Histories\n",
      "6\n",
      "Defendant argues that Applicant provided inaccurate and inconsistent\n",
      "testimony when he told Dr. Kauss that despite being thwarted in his attempts for\n",
      "a promotion, there were good promotion opportunities at the County of Los\n",
      "Angeles purportedly contradicting what he told Dr. Nehorayan. Defendant also\n",
      "argues that while Applicant testified that Dr. Sherrill did not want to hear about\n",
      "events prior to when he went on leave, that Dr. Sherrill testified in her deposition\n",
      "that she felt it would be important to be provided with further information\n",
      "regarding the alleged whistleblowing activities.\n",
      "The undersigned disagrees that the record is inconsistent or inaccurate in\n",
      "this regard. The statement in the report of Dr. Kauss was that \"Mr. Larson\n",
      "reports that there were good promotional opportunities, but that he was thwarted\n",
      "in his attempts to promote.\" This statement is consistent with his testimony at\n",
      "trial and that given to all the doctors. With respect to the claims of inconsistent\n",
      "statements to Dr. Sherrill, Applicant was not present at Dr. Sherrill's deposition\n",
      "and what she said to the Applicant at the evaluation is not refuted by a\n",
      "subsequent deposition. Finally, the fact that Applicant was later offered a\n",
      "promotion opportunity does not in and of itself negate Event #1.\n",
      "c. Event #1 is Barred by the Statute of Limitation\n",
      "Several events during one period of cumulative trauma may be combined\n",
      "to determine whether the predominant cause requirement is met. The appeals\n",
      "board has also held that the predominant cause requirement may be met by\n",

      "Here, the Defendant is arguing that one of the several events in the medical\n",
      "report of Dr. Nehorayan, to wit, Event #1 (denial of promotion in 2016 to Human\n",
      "Resources Analyst IV) is barred by the statute of limitation pursuant to Labor\n",

      "11.\n",
      "See Applicant Exhibit “2”, at p. 11.\n",
      "7\n",
      "Code section 5405 since Applicant previously filed a stress claim that was\n",
      "denied in 2016/2017.\n",
      "The burden of proving that a claim is barred by the statute of limitations\n",
      "and that estoppel does not apply belongs to the employer. Sidders v. WCAB, 53\n",
      "Cal. Comp Cases, 445. Additionally, the statute of limitations defense must be\n",
      "specifically raised by the employer and does not apply automatically even if its\n",
      "conditions are met. This defense is a \"use it or lose it\" defense. Thus, an\n",
      "extensive discussion of Labor Code section 5405 or Reynolds v. WCAB, 12 Cal.\n",
      "3d 726 is not warranted. Defendant did not raise this affirmative defense at trial\n",
      "as such the issue is waived.\n",
      "II.\n",
      "DEFENDANT MET ITS BURDEN OF PROOF OF LAWFUL\n",
      "NON- DISCRIMINATORY GOOD FAITH PERSONNEL\n",
      "ACTION\n",
      "Defendant further argues that it met its burden of proof that Events 1-3,\n",
      "were lawful non- discriminatory good faith personnel actions. For Event #1,\n",
      "Defendant argues that there was no evidence of personnel records to explain why\n",
      "the Applicant did not receive the promotion or that the promoted candidate did\n",
      "not score as well. This argument appears to be a recitation of the argument\n",
      "related to objective evidence discussed supra. Suffice it to state that it would be\n",
      "highly unlikely that Applicant would have been able to obtain records of another\n",
      "employee not a party to this case even if he requested it. Moreover, Defendant\n",
      "was best suited to provide that rebuttal evidence at trial through exhibits or\n",
      "testimony but failed to do so. Defendant's statement that its witness provided\n",
      "testimony that County procedures regarding hiring were followed is distorted.\n",
      "Defendant's witness, Mr. Horvath, did not rebut any of the Applicant's\n",
      "testimony related to Event #1. Instead, his testimony regarding the hiring and\n",
      "promotion was a general response to a question by the court as outlined supra.\n",
      "Defendant argues that it successfully rebutted Event #2 as related to\n",
      "Applicant being blocked for a promotion within his current department as this\n",
      "was rebutted by Mr. Horvath who testified that the position had not been open\n",
      "for recruitment. Defendant appears to have mixed up Event 2 with Event 4. The\n",
      "undersigned did find that Event #4 related to the failure to hire Applicant to the\n",
      "position of Assistant Administrator was successfully rebutted by Mr. Horvath.\n",
      "Defendant did not provide any rebuttal evidence to Event #2.\n",
      "Finally, Defendant argues that there is no evidence of any negative work\n",
      "evaluation to support Event #3. Again, this appears to be a recital of arguments\n",
      "supra. The undersigned would again reiterate that Defendant raised a good faith\n",
      "personnel defense but failed to provide any rebuttal evidence.\n",

      "THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE FINDINGS OF\n",

      "SHOULD BE DEFERRED\n",
      "Here, Defendant begins by arguing that Dr. Sherrill found no industrial\n",
      "injury; however, the undersigned did not rely on the report of Dr. Sherrill as\n",
      "outlined in the Findings of Fact. Defendant also raised two additional issues: a)\n",

      "Defendant's argument that Dr. Nehorayan's report does not meet the\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The above entitled matter was originally tried and submitted before the undersigned\n",
      "judge on November 13, 2019. I awarded partial attorney fees to the cost petitioner\n",
      "for Dr. Konstat's representation. Defendant filed a Petition for Reconsideration,\n",
      "objecting to any award of attorney fees as part of their argument. The WCAB\n",
      "granted the Petition, which resulted in another Petition for Reconsideration, but\n",
      "filed by cost petitioner, Dr. Konstat's, attorney, Ms. Kapelnikov. The matter was\n",
      "then remanded to the trial level before the undersigned WCJ on the issue of whether\n",
      "Defendant acted in bad faith to warrant \"sanctionable conduct\" which could then\n",
      "result in cost petitioner's attorney's fees being reimbursed by Defendant.\n",
      "The matter was submitted the second time on February 9, 2022 with a Findings and\n",
      "Order issuing on April 8, 2022, this time concluding that not only did Defendant\n",
      "not act in bad faith, but that no award of attorney fees would issue. Ms. Kapelnikov\n",
      "filed a Petition for Reconsideration on April 27, 2022, again arguing that Defendant\n",
      "acted in bad faith and that its behavior was sanctionable which warrants an award\n",
      "attorney fees. The Defendant did not file an Answer.\n",
      "Based upon a review of the entire record and the subject Petition, it is respectfully\n",
      "recommended that the Petition be denied.\n",
      "II. Facts and Discussion on Sanctions and Attorney Fees\n",
      "I issued a Findings and Order dated April 8, 2022, and found, once again, that\n",
      "Defendant did not act in bad faith, and that no sanctions were warranted, and so no\n",
      "attorney's fees were awarded either per former CCR Sections 10451.1(g)(1)(A)&(B)\n",
      "and 10561 (now 10421) and LC Section 5813. I originally found that cost petitioner\n",
      "should receive some attorney fees for the work done to effectuate the settlement\n",
      "with Defendant of Dr. Konstat's billing in mid-2019 when the petition for non-IBR\n",
      "Determination was filed on 3/5/2019. This is what triggered Defendant to discover\n",
      "the unit error of 7 vs. 74 for the first time, as the original request for secondary bill\n",
      "review the year before indicated the billing was erroneously down-coded from an\n",
      "ML104 to an ML101. That's why when the secondary bill review was requested,\n",
      "the bill review results of 4/24/18 indicated that Dr. Konstat's billing was duplicative\n",
      "and no further monies were owed, even though this second bill review showed 74\n",
      "units. It was because the secondary bill review only requested an analysis under\n",
      "ML104, not ML101. It was not until the March 2019 non-IBR petition was served\n",
      "that Defendant discovered the 7 vs. 74 unit discrepancy issue.\n",
      "After the petition issued in March 2019, the parties quickly negotiated a settlement\n",
      "for $6,190.79 for the entirety of Dr. Konstat's billing, including sanctions, penalties\n",
      "and interest. The settlement left open the issue of attorney fees.\n",
      "I found that when Defendant resolved the Dr. Konstat bill in April 2019, it was\n",
      "acting in good faith. Part of former CCR Section 10451.1(g)(1) is that due to bad\n",
      "faith actions or tactics, or if a defendant fails to comply with timeliness\n",
      "requirements, they shall be liable for the provider's attorney fees. Bad faith actions\n",
      "may include failure to pay an uncontested portion of a medical-legal bill, or failing\n",
      "to make a good faith effort to timely comply. LC Section 5813 sanctions include\n",
      "when a party taking a position intended to harass or injury or done solely to cause\n",
      "unnecessary delay or needless increase in litigation costs. It also looks to whether\n",
      "there is no reasonable excuse or where there is a pattern of conduct. See CCR former\n",
      "Section 10561.\n",
      "The point is that Defendant, while it underpaid originally, did not know it had\n",
      "underpaid until mid-March 2019. Then it settled the entire bill with the provider a\n",
      "month later, well within the 60 days to make a payment, if they were to re-run the\n",
      "billing using the 74 unit codes instead of the 7. It was never about a billing of ML\n",
      "104 versus an ML 101. Neither party knew or discovered this, including Dr. Konstat\n",
      "apparently, until about March 2019. In fact, in the secondary bill review request\n",
      "and IBR request (which was denied because it was deemed untimely and not based\n",
      "on the merits), the issue of 7 vs. 74 was not raised.\n",
      "Then there is the IBR request of 5/24/2018 which was clearly based on the same\n",
      "presumed reduction- from an ML104 to an ML101. But this had never happened.\n",
      "Even the petitioner did not know or notice at the time about the unit error and\n",
      "thought they had simply been down coded erroneously from an ML104 to an ML1\n",
      "01. And that is why when Defendant received the second bill review request, it did\n",
      "not allow for more fees - it was because the Appeal concentrated on the ML104 vs.\n",
      "ML101 issue.\n",
      "I am aware the language of the code indicates \"shall be subject to attorney fees\",\n",
      "costs, etc., but I also do not read the statute strictly so as to forgive mistakes versus\n",
      "acts clearly done in bad faith and the legislative intent. This was obviously a clerical\n",
      "error which was rectified when the non-IBR petition was received and defendant\n",
      "took immediate remedial measures to correct the situation and settle the bill within\n",
      "30 days. I will not punish a party for correcting its errors right away upon\n",
      "discovering them. I even note in the 4/12/2019 emails between Resolution Partners\n",
      "and the provider's attorney (which was pointed out by petitioner itself at the\n",
      "Reconsideration, page 3), that Ms. Long of Resolution Partners indicated they\n",
      "would negotiate the attorney fees but stated, \"I do want to take care of the doctor\n",
      "asap.\" To me, that is nothing close to \"bad faith\" warranting an attorney fee award.\n",
      "The defendant did not maliciously or intentionally underpay this bill or change the\n",
      "codes to reduce it somehow. If knowledge and intent is not attributed to the\n",
      "Defendant, nor a pattern or course of conduct, then neither can it be found that they\n",
      "acted in bad faith, frivolously, or with intent to delay, harass, costs, etc.\n",
      "Another factor to consider on the lack of finding of bad faith or sanctionable\n",
      "conduct here was that when Defendant resolved the bill of the medical-legal\n",
      "provider in April 2019, it was paid in full plus penalties and interest. If Defendant\n",
      "intended to harass, delay, underpay, or avoid the provider in any way, they would\n",
      "not have voluntarily and so easily have paid it in full within 30 days, plus the\n",
      "requested penalties and interest, unless Defendant recognized immediately that it\n",
      "had made such a mistake. Most Defendants (at least in the Los Angeles area) would\n",
      "attempt to reduce and negotiate this bill, even in the face of such a mistake, but this\n",
      "Defendant did not.\n",
      "Petitioner's attorney also argues at page 5 of the Reconsideration that it was also\n",
      "bad faith actions or tactics when Ms. Long of Resolution Partners allegedly failed\n",
      "or refused to negotiate further on her attorney fee demand after Dr. Konstat's bill\n",
      "was resolved in April 2019. The fact is defendant found the $350 hourly rate\n",
      "claimed as unreasonable given the experience and years of practice of the attorney\n",
      "representing the provider. It was also an inflated amount of time stated. But the\n",
      "issues cannot be muddled here - the issue was whether defendant acted in bad faith\n",
      "when it mistakenly underpaid Dr. Konstat's bill, requiring her to hire an attorney\n",
      "and file the non-IBR petition. The issue was not whether Defendant refused or\n",
      "failed to negotiate with the attorney on her own bills after the doctor was resolved.\n",
      "I agreed with Defendant that the hourly rate and time spent (claimed) was excessive\n",
      "and I originally awarded fees but at a reduced amount. However, if one could claim\n",
      "\"bad faith\" and sanctions on every party that did not return emails or phone calls or\n",
      "negotiate further, the legal system would be bogged down for 100 years in advance.\n",
      "Cost petitioner did what it is legally entitled to do, and should do, to prosecute its\n",
      "fee demand - file a DOR to get on the WCAB calendar and try the issue before a\n",
      "judge.\n",
      "Petitioner also argues in its petition that under LC Section 5811, it is owed attorney\n",
      "fees, but this section specifically deals with interpreters for medical-legal services\n",
      "and billing. It does not pertain to Dr. Konstat. It also does not pertain to where\n",
      "clerical errors have been made that neither party knew of until a year later.\n",
      "Also, I have to point out that the provider, up until March 2019, had subjected itself\n",
      "to the IBR process and as far as the Defendant was concerned, its IBR request of\n",
      "April 2018 was denied as untimely in May 2018, so Defendant would have deemed\n",
      "the issue resolved and would have had no way of even knowing that a cost petition\n",
      "was going to be filed 10 or 11 months later as an alternative path for the PQME to\n",
      "collect her funds. They also could have simply contacted defendant by letter or\n",
      "email or phone call to bring their attention to the unit error issue. This was\n",
      "essentially the provider's \"second bite at the apple\" and still the Defendant paid it\n",
      "in full plus penalties and interest. In other words, the very first time Defendant\n",
      "became aware of the mistake was in mid-March 2019, and the issue was resolved\n",
      "in a few weeks.\n",
      "Therefore, on remand on the limited issue of sanctionable conduct warranting\n",
      "attorney fees, I incorporate my prior Findings and Award and Order, as well as the\n",
      "present one from April 2022, to conclude Defendant did not act in bad faith here\n",
      "and no sanctions are warranted. If no sanctions would be awarded for bad faith\n",
      "conduct, then no attorney fees could be awarded either. If the fees must be based\n",

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "We first address the timeliness of this Opinion. Labor Code¹ section 5909 provides that a\n",
      "petition for reconsideration is deemed denied unless the Appeals Board acts on the petition within\n",
      "60 days of filing. (§ 5909.) Applicant filed his Petition for Reconsideration on February 28, 2022.\n",
      "The Appeals Board had until April 29, 2022 to act on the Petition. However, the Appeals Board\n",
      "did not receive notice of it until May 5, 2022.\n",
      "It “is a fundamental principle of due process that a party may not be deprived of a\n",
      "substantial right without notice....\" (Shipley v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th\n",
      "1104, 1108 [57 Cal.Comp.Cases 493].) In Shipley, the Appeals Board denied applicant's petition\n",
      "for reconsideration because the Appeals Board had not acted on the petition within the statutory\n",
      "time limits of section 5909. The Appeals Board did not act on applicant's petition because it had\n",
      "misplaced the file, through no fault of the parties. The Court of Appeal reversed the Appeals\n",
      "Board's decision holding that the time to act on applicant's petition was tolled during the period\n",
      "1 Subsequent statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise indicated.\n",
      "2\n",
      "that the file was misplaced. (Id. at p. 1108.) Like the Court in Shipley, \"we are not convinced that\n",
      "the burden of the system's inadequacies should fall on [a party].” (Id. at p. 1108.) Therefore,\n",
      "considering that applicant filed a timely petition for reconsideration on February 28, 2022 and that\n",
      "our failure to act was due to a procedural error, we find that our time to act on applicant's petition\n",
      "for reconsideration was tolled until May 5, 2022, the date we received the Petition. Accordingly,\n",
      "per section 5909, the deadline to act on this Petition is extended to July 5, 2022. Therefore, this\n",
      "Opinion is timely.\n",
      "Turning to the issues in this matter, SIBTF seeks reconsideration of a discovery order,\n",
      "which is not a final order. A petition for reconsideration may properly be taken only from a “final”\n",
      "order, decision, or award. (§§ 5900(a), 5902, 5903.) A \"final\" order has been defined as one that\n",

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "We first note that in his Report, the WCJ stated:\n",
      "Drs. Haronian, Drakshani, and Farsar all agreed that the employee has sustained\n",
      "cumulative trauma to the left shoulder and right knee as well as the low back.\n",

      "The physicians received accurate histories and made identical findings of injury,\n",
      "need for care and disabilities. Hence the preponderance of evidence supports the\n",
      "finding of injury to the left shoulder and right knee.\n",
      "(Report, p. 3.)\n",
      "Having again reviewed the trial record, we agree with the WCJ that the reports from Drs.\n",
      "Haronian, Drakshani and Farsar constitute substantial evidence that applicant sustained a\n",
      "cumulative injury AOE/COE to his left shoulder and right knee.\n",
      "As to defendant's argument that applicant actually sustained his right knee injury in 1997,\n",
      "the WCJ explained that:\n",
      "All physicians were told about the prior right knee surgery many years earlier.\n",
      "So the histories received by the physicians herein were correct. What may likely\n",
      "result in apportionment issues later on in the litigation does not negate the\n",
      "opinion on causation put forth by all three physicians in this matter.\n",
      "(Report, p. 3.)\n",
      "Finally, defendant argues that since no new testimony or medical evidence was presented\n",
      "at the May 4, 2022 trial, “it is difficult to see how\" the WCJ \"could have now found the applicant\n",
      "3\n",
      "credible in relation to the claim for a left shoulder injury.\" (Petition, p. 10.) In his August 1, 2019\n",
      "Report, the WCJ stated:\n",
      "The undersigned admits that the litigation herein centered on Applicant's low\n",
      "back. ... The discussion of knees and shoulders was limited at best… ¶ … The\n",
      "undersigned therefore agrees with Petitioner [defendant] that injury to the\n",
      "shoulder(s) or knee(s) is significantly in doubt. And, as pointed out above, those\n",

      "(Report, August 1, 2019, p. 5.)\n",

      "I. INTRODUCTION\n",
      "The injured employee is a 46 year old roofing supply dispatcher, roofer, driver\n",
      "and sales representative who sustained injuries at work during the period 1988\n",
      "through 2/10/2014 to his low back, left shoulder and right knee.\n",
      "The Petitioner is the Defendant who claims that the undersigned erred by finding\n",
      "injury to the left shoulder and right knee.\n",
      "This matter was originally tried in 2018 and 2019 as the result of priority\n",
      "hearings on the issue of injury.\n",
      "Thereafter injury to the low back was found. The only issues at this trial were\n",
      "injury to the left shoulder and right knee.\n",
      "II. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n",
      "The claim by the Applicant was for injury by way of cumulative trauma during\n",
      "his 26 years of employment with the Defendant. Two prior trials established\n",
      "that the employee sustained injuries from 1988 to 2/10/214 to his low back. Dr.\n",
      "Nader Farsar acted as the PQME in this case (Court's Exs. X-1 – 4). Dr. Shiva\n",
      "Drakshani first saw the patient on an attorney referral on 11/13/2015 (App's Ex.\n",
      "1). Dr. Edwin Haronian saw the patient on an orthopedic referral from Drakshani\n",
      "on 6/10/2016 (Df's Ex. D). Applicant testified at trial on 7/30/2018 that he\n",
      "developed right knee, low back and left shoulder complaints while working\n",
      "(Minutes of Hearing, 7/30/2018, p.3, line 3).\n",
      "Drs. Haronian, Drakshani and Farsar all agreed that the employee has sustained\n",
      "cumulative trauma to the left shoulder and right knee as well as the low back.\n",
      "In prior hearings there were significant disputes as to date of injury, body parts\n",
      "and job duties. These disputes were resolved by the Decision After\n",
      "Reconsideration dated 9/30/2019. At that point the findings of fact found that\n",
      "injury was to the low back. Injury to other body parts was deferred.\n",
      "The trial conducted on 5/4/2022 was solely on the issue of injury to the left\n",
      "shoulder and right knee. No new evidence was proffered.\n",
      "Based upon the opinions of Drs. Farsar, Haronian and Drakshani the\n",
      "undersigned found that the Applicant herein did sustain injury to his left shoulder\n",
      "and right knee. No other issues were before the Court.\n",
      "III. DISCUSSION\n",
      "6\n",
      "A finding of injury must be based upon substantial medical evidence. The\n",
      "evidence must be sufficient so that a reasonable mind might find the evidence to\n",
      "be adequate to support a medical conclusion. Braewood Convalescent Hospital\n",
      "v. WCAB (Bolton) (1983) 48 CCC 566. Such opinions must be credible and not\n",
      "based on inadequate medical histories, surmise, conjecture or guess. Place v.\n",
      "WCAB (1970) 35 CCC 575.\n",
      "A finding of fact must also be based on a review of all the evidence and not\n",
      "simply upon an isolated fact that disregards the entire record. Bracken v. WCAB\n",
      "(1989) 54 CCC 349.\n",
      "In this case the Petitioner urges a finding that the evidence is not substantial to\n",
      "support the finding of injury to the right knee or left shoulder.\n",
      "The basis of the appeal on the left shoulder is that the Applicant's testimony in\n",
      "deposition is inconsistent with regards to the left shoulder claim.\n",
      "The basis for the appeal of the right knee is based upon the claim that Applicant\n",
      "previously had undergone right knee surgery 20 years earlier.\n",
      "Left Shoulder\n",
      "There was inconsistent testimony on the shoulder claim in the deposition.\n",
      "However the undersigned took note of Dr. Farsar's report (Ex. X-1) which noted\n",
      "that this unsophisticated claimant told him that he had right shoulder complaints\n",
      "but pointed to his left shoulder (Ex. X-1, p.4).\n",
      "More importantly, the complaints to Drs. Drakshani and Haronian were to the\n",
      "left shoulder. Applicant's testimony indicated complaints in the left shoulder.\n",
      "Even more importantly, the findings by all doctors were in the left shoulder. Dr.\n",
      "Farsar found range of motion abnormalities in the left shoulder (Ex. X-1, p.6).\n",
      "There were no findings on the right shoulder. In fact Dr. Farsar declared\n",
      "Applicant P&S with 5% wpi in the left shoulder.\n",
      "Dr. Haronian received a history of left shoulder complaints (Ex. D, p.3). His\n",
      "conclusions were that Applicant suffered from an impingement of the left\n",
      "shoulder (p.8).\n",
      "So while there may have been confusion, the preponderance of the evidence by\n",
      "the physicians clearly favors a finding of injury to the left shoulder. The lack of\n",
      "any findings on the right shoulder dispels the theory that injury was on the right.\n",
      "Right Knee\n",
      "All physicians were told about the prior right knee surgery many years earlier.\n",
      "So the histories received by the physicians herein were correct. What may likely\n",
      "7\n",
      "result in apportionment issues later on in the litigation does not negate the\n",
      "opinion on causation put forth by all three physicians in this matter.\n",
      "Dr. Farsar found pain, loss of strength, loss of range of motion and arthrogram\n",
      "abnormalities to substantiate the findings of injury to the right knee (Ex. X-1, p.\n",
      "9).\n",
      "Dr. Haronian's right knee exam is in agreement with Dr. Farsar (Ex. D, p.7).\n",
      "The Applicant worked in an occupation from 1988 to 1997 that would be\n",
      "considered very arduous. Thereafter the evidence supported the finding that\n",
      "Applicant worked until 2014 performing similar physical activities on a lessor\n",
      "extent due to a change of jobs. The physicians received accurate histories and\n",
      "made identical findings of injury, need for care and disabilities. Hence the\n",
      "preponderance of evidence supports the finding of injury to the left shoulder and\n",
      "right knee.\n",

      "Jonathan Nassos, M.D., dated September 30, 2016, p. 173.) Dr. Nassos requested authorization for\n",
      "a variety of conservative treatment modalities including physical therapy and medication. (Id. at\n",

      "While she has received 12 sessions of physical therapy and five sessions of\n",
      "occupational therapy, this has not been adequate. In discussion with her, it sounds\n",
      "like there has been quite a bit of delay in the therapy and no continuity of care\n",

      "hyperesthesia of the left arm, rather than Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. (Ex. BB, report of\n",
      "PQME Rosabel Young, M.D., dated February 18, 2020.) The QME identified neurological\n",

      "applicant's outcome. (Ex. AA, transcript of the deposition of Daniel Kaplan, dated April 24, 2020,\n",
      "at 14:22.) When asked to expand on his diagnosis of CRPS, Dr. Kaplan responded that his\n",
      "assessment arose out of findings of \"markedly decreased range of motion of the shoulder and\n",
      "elbow, excessive tenderness to palpations, paraspinous spasm, changes in the appearance of her\n",
      "skin, [and] limited range of motion in her fingers.” Dr. Kaplan reiterated his opinion that applicant\n",
      "was permanent and totally disabled, explaining that applicant's disability arose out of the \"absence\n",
      "of any use of her left upper extremity due to the reflex dystrophy and then she is markedly limited\n",
      "in use of her right upper extremity due to the tendinitis of her right shoulder, adhesive capsulitis\n",
      "of her right shoulder, and tendinitis of the right wrist.” (Id. at 23:20.) The QME was also asked\n",
      "whether additional treatment would alter applicant's status as permanent and stationary:\n",
      "If she got treatment and improved. If she got treatment and there was no change\n",
      "in her condition, then she would still be P&S. So if treatment afforded her\n",
      "improvement, then she might be considered to no longer be P&S. (Id. at 30:14).\n",
      "On April 28, 2020, neurology QME Dr. Young issued a supplemental report, noting again\n",
      "that she felt applicant did not meet the diagnostic criteria for CRPS, that applicant had paresthesia\n",
      "and allodynia, but not vascular color changes or persistent swelling. (Ex. CC, report of PQME\n",
      "Rosabel Young, M.D., dated April 28, 2020, p. 14.) After a review of additional records, Dr. Young\n",

      "framing issues relevant to the nature and extent of the injury. Following submission of the matter\n",
      "for decision, the WCJ issued rating instructions, which were served along with the formal ratings\n",

      "trial that she could not remember the names of some of her medications or dosages. (Minutes, at\n",
      "10:4.) Applicant testified that she is in constant pain, that her medication usage is dependent on\n",
      "her pain levels, and that the medication makes her sleepy. (Minutes, at 4:1, 9:21.) Defendant puts\n",
      "forward no medical opinion or evidence from any treating or evaluating physician that documents\n",
      "a material change in applicant's condition. Nor does the record reveal any significant alteration in\n",
      "applicant's physical abilities, activities of daily living, significant interim medical treatment, or\n",

      "permanent and stationary.\n",
      "Defendant contends that the reporting of applicant's vocational expert Mr. Broadus is not\n",
      "substantial evidence. (Petition, at 8:16.) However, the formal ratings instructions issued by the\n",
      "WCJ yielded 100% permanent disability without reliance on vocational evidence. (January 14,\n",

      "reflects no objection lodged by any party to the ratings instructions or the resulting Report of\n",

      "Rosabel Young, M.D., dated February 18, 2020, p. 32.) In deposition, Dr. Kaplan responded to the\n",
      "differences in diagnosis as follows:\n",
      "Well, CRPS is a very frustrating problem in the medical/legal world because, as\n",
      "I testified earlier, there's no test to make the call. It's a clinical diagnosis. So you\n",
      "could have two clinicians who are both experts in the field and they may disagree\n",
      "on the diagnosis of CRPS in a given individual because the diagnosis is made\n",
      "based on clinical suspicion and clinical findings rather than a black-and-white\n",
      "test. So your characterization of the neurologist's report doesn't surprise me. I\n",
      "think you could find other examiners who would say she has CRPS, other\n",
      "examiners who would say she has a frozen shoulder. You can have both. She can\n",
      "have a frozen shoulder and CRPS. So I think it's going to be difficult to get a\n",
      "consensus from multiple different examiners of what's going on because each\n",
      "person can provide the factual basis to support their diagnosis and it doesn't mean\n",
      "I'm right and he's wrong or vice versa unfortunately. (Ex. AA, transcript of the\n",

      "asserted that he had been terminated for cause on October 1, 2020 and that accommodated work\n",

      "The matter went forward to trial on September 8, 2021. The applicant testified as well as\n",

      "applicant and awarded temporary disability from October 2, 2021 through the date the applicant\n",
      "became permanent and stationary (November 3, 2021, Jt. Ex. 1 ). The finding that the termination\n",

      "for two weeks, and then four hours a day, three times a week for six weeks. (Court Exhibit S.)\n",
      "The parties agreed to utilize the orthopedic AME, Roger Sohn, M.D., on the issue of home\n",

      "FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n",
      "The factual background of this case, as set forth at pages 1-5 of the\n",
      "Opinion on Decision (Opinion), is as follows:\n",
      "At trial, applicant testified on direct examination that\n",
      "11/11/18 is the approximate date of first injury. It was resolved via\n",
      "stipulations in May of 2020. Her left wrist, right shoulder and\n",
      "tailbone were injured then.\n",
      "She has another injury date when she reinjured her shoulder\n",
      "in August of 2020. She was in another position where she was\n",
      "repetitively moving her shoulder. It was later determined that this\n",
      "was a new claim. She was not sent to see a physician for this injury.\n",
      "She was told the claim was denied because it was not deemed a new\n",
      "injury. She was off work for a short period but was able to work\n",
      "with accommodations. Her right shoulder worsened with range of\n",
      "motion and pain.\n",
      "She was seen by Dr. Chow on 10/1/21, and was given\n",
      "additional restrictions. She emailed this to Ashley Stevens, at her\n",
      "employer, and to their HR person, Eleanor Bruton. They could not\n",
      "accommodate her after that through today.\n",
      "She was called before the Christmas break, by someone she\n",
      "had never spoken to before at VCUSD, who asked if she was seen\n",
      "on 12/1/21.\n",
      "She got a pay raise when she got a promotion to high school\n",
      "office manager, which was negotiated by her union.\n",
      "2\n",
      "She was off work for a non-industrial condition on 8/20/21.\n",
      "She was paid partial pay from 10/1/21, which is much less\n",
      "than her TD rate.\n",
      "On cross-examination, applicant stated that the ending date\n",
      "of the non-industrial condition is 11/17/21. She was taken off work\n",
      "for this by Dr. Fulton. She was last seen by Dr. Fulton on November\n",
      "of 2021. At that time, there was no discussion of extending the non-\n",
      "industrial disability leave. She has a follow-up appointment with\n",
      "Dr. Fulton at the end of January of 2022.\n",
      "She recalls seeing Dr. Renbaum, the AME. She doesn't\n",
      "recall the level of pain then, but it was less than it is now. Regarding\n",
      "the frequency of pain in shoulder, she doesn't recall, either.\n",
      "She doesn't recall an increase in her shoulder pain just before\n",
      "the August 2020 event. Her shoulder pain worsened after August of\n",
      "2020. Her shoulder condition hasn't gotten better since then. Her\n",
      "range of motion is now limited. It pops and is much more painful\n",
      "and impacts her sleep and other parts of her life.\n",
      "Dr. Tang, in November of 2020, had her on work\n",
      "restrictions, and they were the same that she had for a long period.\n",
      "She believes her lifting restriction was at ten pounds then. It's more\n",
      "extensive now.\n",
      "She never returned to full duty after the first injury.\n",
      "The 10/1/21 report by Dr. Chow (1 page) was provided to\n",
      "her employer that same day. She doesn't know if it lists her date of\n",
      "injury. She didn't provide a more comprehensive report to her\n",
      "employer. There is an 11/1/21 fax imprint date, but that's nothing\n",
      "she ever faxed. She hasn't discussed this report with her employer\n",
      "since 10/1/21.\n",
      "The last date she worked for VCUSD was 8/13/21. She\n",
      "worked full time up until then. The school work year started 8/1/21.\n",
      "She was taken off work on 8/13/21 due to arm pain from\n",
      "working the day before. She was seen in the emergency department,\n",
      "where she received a Toradal shot, and was taken off of work for\n",
      "five days.\n",
      "3\n",
      "She was then seen by her psychologist for a regularly-set\n",
      "appointment, and the psychologist took her off of work.\n",
      "The shoulder has now become more symptomatic.\n",
      "On 8/12/21, she believes she overused the shoulder. It had\n",
      "been hurting her for several days before that. She tried to be seen\n",
      "by a workers' compensation doctor but was unable to do so for a\n",
      "time.\n",
      "Regarding Exhibit Q, the report of Dr. Tolentino, dated\n",
      "5/25/21, she attempted to make a follow-up appointment but was\n",
      "unable to do so. Dr. Tolentino didn't have records or Kaiser\n",
      "information and she couldn't do anything for her. She was upset\n",
      "because Dr. Tolentino could not help her or give her any treatment.\n",
      "Since 10/1/21, she got some pay from VCUSD and some\n",
      "disability from private insurance, in the amount of $1,300, from\n",
      "American Fidelity that she pays for and gets through her employer.\n",
      "This covered from 8/20/21 - 11/7/21 for her psychiatric condition.\n",
      "From VCUSD, she got $1,000 for September and $2,000 for\n",
      "October. She received a partial payment for November, which she\n",
      "believes was $2,000. These payments are made by the employer,\n",
      "per the union agreement. She believes this is a short-term disability\n",
      "leave, and this is nothing that she pays for.\n",
      "Dr. Renbaum hasn't addressed her August 2020 injury.\n",
      "When she was seen by Dr. Chow, she doesn't recall if she\n",
      "told him about Dr. Renbaum's permanent and stationary\n",
      "determination. They discussed the August 2020 injury and the\n",
      "change in her condition. He didn't differentiate whether work\n",
      "restrictions were from her first injury versus her second injury.\n",
      "Since 8/13/21, she hasn't worked for anyone else. No\n",
      "activities outside of work since August of 2021 have increased her\n",
      "pain.\n",
      "Her last physical therapy appointment was last week.\n",
      "On re-direct examination, she testified that the 8/28/20\n",
      "injury was denied before she was first seen by Dr. Chow. She\n",
      "doesn't know if he was authorized to treat her for the second injury.\n",

      "injury, I would have granted reconsideration and found temporary disability only until December\n",
      "29. 2021.\n",
      "The evidentiary record contains a status report from primary treating physician dated\n",
      "November 1, 2021. However, it appears that the date is a typographical error, since the report\n",
      "states that applicant \"is status post ultrasound-guided right shoulder subacromial cortisone\n",

      "report is a Request for Authorization and a disability slip each dated December 1, 2021. In any\n",
      "case, the disability slip states that “The patient indicated above will be able/unable to work for a\n",
      "period of 4 wks from 12/01/2021 to 12/29/2022 [sic]\" on \"full time modified duty. If unable to\n",

      "40% to the specific [industrial] incident of March 6, 2015.” (Exhibit CC, p. 15.) Dr. Han further\n",
      "supported his opinion on apportionment by explaining that applicant had prior surgeries, fell off a\n",
      "curb in 2016, and had obesity, which all contributed to degenerative changes in applicant's knees\n",
      "that necessitated her bilateral knee replacement surgeries. (Id.) In his supplemental report of July\n",
      "5, 2019, Dr. Han reaffirmed his prior opinion on apportionment, stating that applicant's “long\n",
      "history of pre-existing knee conditions and injuries and surgeries and morbid obesity significantly\n",
      "contributed to the ultimate need for total knee replacements bilaterally.\" (Exhibit DD, p. 2.)\n",
      "Based on the above review of Dr. Han's reports, we note the doctor did employ language\n",
      "describing causation of the injury and the need for applicant's bilateral knee replacements, in\n",
      "contrast to language that seeks to isolate the causes of permanent disability. (See Reyes v. Hart\n",
      "Plastering (2005) 70 Cal.Comp.Cases 223 [Significant Panel Decision].) Nevertheless, we agree\n",
      "with the WCJ that Dr. Han’s medical opinion still rises to the level of substantial evidence of\n",
      "apportionment under Escobedo, because the doctor evaluated applicant's permanent impairment\n",
      "based on the result of her bilateral knee replacement surgeries. Dr. Han convincingly explained\n",
      "that apportionment of the need for those surgeries applied equally to apportionment of the\n",
      "permanent impairment.\n",
      "However, we do not adopt or incorporate the discussion of Hikida found in the WCJ's\n",
      "Report. In Hikida, the injured employee sustained industrial injury in the form of carpal tunnel\n",
      "syndrome, and she underwent surgery to alleviate that condition. The surgery was unsuccessful\n",
      "and resulted in the injured employee developing chronic regional pain syndrome (\"CRPS\"). The\n",
      "CRPS left her permanently and totally disabled. On one hand, the Agreed Medical Evaluator\n",
      "(\"AME\") concluded that the permanent and total disability was entirely due to the injured\n",
      "employee's new CRPS condition. On the other hand, the AME found apportionment based on his\n",
      "opinion that 10% of the disability resulting from the original carpal tunnel syndrome condition\n",
      "was non-industrial. On those facts, the Court of Appeal framed the issue as \"whether an employer\n",
      "is responsible for both the medical treatment and any disability arising directly from unsuccessful\n",
      "medical intervention, without apportionment.\" (Hikida, supra, 12 Cal.App.5th at 1260, italics\n",
      "added.) Although the Court answered yes to that specific question, the Court further explained in\n",
      "pertinent part: \"Nothing in the 2004 legislation [broadening application of apportionment] had\n",
      "any impact on the reasoning that has long supported the employer's responsibility to compensate\n",
      "3\n",
      "for medical treatment and the consequences of medical treatment without apportionment.\"\n",
      "(Hikida, supra, 12 Cal.App.5th at 1263, italics added.)\n",
      "Given the additional rationale just stated, it might be posited that the Hikida principle is\n",
      "not limited to situations involving failed treatment or new injuries. In County of Santa Clara v.\n",
      "Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (Justice) (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 605, 615 [85 Cal.Comp.Cases 467],\n",
      "however, the Court of Appeal does seem to have made an attempt to limit Hikida, with the Court\n",
      "in Justice stating: “Hikida precludes apportionment only where the industrial medical treatment\n",
      "is the sole cause of the permanent disability.\" (Italics added.)\n",
      "The instant case is more like Justice than Hikida. In Hikida, the injured employee\n",
      "developed the entirely new medical condition of CRPS following her treatment and surgery,\n",
      "whereas here, as in Justice, the applicant had a significant prior history of the same knee problems\n",

      "Applicant had an initial QME evaluation with Dr. Han on April 13, 2017 where she was found not\n",
      "permanent and stationary. (Joint Exhibit BB) She returned for a re-evaluation on March 21, 2019,\n",
      "which resulted in a report dated April 5, 2019 wherein Dr. Han provided a record review, physical\n",

      "The basis for apportionment must be clear; the medical-legal report must “describe in detail the\n",

      "Marshalls (2007) 70 Cal. Comp. Cases 604, 621. This means that the medical-legal report must\n",
      "explain the nature of the non-industrial factor, and how and why the non-industrial factor is\n",
      "responsible for part of the disability. Id. at 622. In his report dated report dated April 5, 2019, Dr.\n",
      "Han apportioned 60% of the disability to pre-existing and 40% to the industrial injury. He\n",
      "explained that Applicant had prior surgeries, fell off a curb in 2016, and had obesity resulting in\n",
      "degenerative changes that made the bilateral total knee replacement surgeries necessary, which is\n",
      "the basis for the permanent disability. (Joint Exhibit CC)\n",
      "In his supplemental report dated July 5, 2019, Dr. Han returned to the issue of apportionment,\n",
      "explaining that Applicant had a long history of pre-existing knee conditions, injuries, surgeries,\n",
      "and obesity that contributed to the need for total knee replacements bilaterally. (Joint Exhibit DD)\n",
      "In his initial report, Dr. Han indicated that Applicant already had significant pre-existing\n",
      "derangements within the right knee for which she was receiving ongoing care. He found that the\n",
      "pre-existing conditions had become significantly worse since the specific incident of March 6,\n",
      "2015. He described the previous right knee arthroscopy in 1995 with residual symptoms and the\n",
      "right knee x-ray from 2012 that revealed degenerative changes that progressed since the prior study\n",
      "in 2007. He described another prior right knee injury on October 21, 2013 and a left knee x-ray\n",
      "from that date revealing moderate tri-compartmental joint space narrowing and osteoarthritis. He\n",
      "described the right knee x-ray done after this specific injury, which revealed similar degenerative\n",
      "findings as the x-ray from 2012. Based on objective findings, Dr. Han opined that the degenerative\n",
      "findings in both knees were predominately pre-existing and Applicant would have required a total\n",
      "knee replacement at some point, which was the basis for the permanent disability finding. (Joint\n",

      "There is reasonable medical probability to identify that greater than 50% of the\n",

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "Labor Code section 4660.1 states in part, that:\n",
      "This section applies to injuries occurring on or after January 1, 2013. ¶ ..\n",
      "(c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the impairment ratings for sleep\n",
      "dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, or psychiatric disorder, or any combination\n",
      "thereof, arising out of a compensable physical injury shall not increase. This\n",
      "section does not limit the ability of an injured employee to obtain treatment for\n",
      "sleep dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, or psychiatric disorder, if any, that are a\n",
      "consequence of an industrial injury. ... ¶(2) An increased impairment rating for\n",
      "psychiatric disorder is not subject to paragraph (1) if the compensable\n",
      "psychiatric injury resulted from either of the following: (A) Being a victim of a\n",
      "violent act or direct exposure to a significant violent act within the meaning of\n",
      "Section 3208.3. (B) A catastrophic injury, including, but not limited to, loss of\n",
      "a limb, paralysis, severe burn, or severe head injury.\n",
      "(Lab. Code, § 4660.1.)¹\n",
      "The nature of the injury sustained is a question of fact for the WCJ. (Western Growers Ins.\n",
      "Co. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (Austin) (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227, 234 [58 Cal.Comp.Cases\n",
      "323].) Whether an injury is “catastrophic\" under section 4660.1(c)(2)(B) is therefore a factual/legal\n",
      "issue for the WCJ to determine. However, it must be noted that section 4660.1(c) does not apply\n",
      "to a psychiatric injury, or injury in the form of sleep dysfunction, if the injuries are directly caused\n",
      "by events of employment. Section 4660.1(c)(1) only bars an increase in the employee's permanent\n",
      "impairment rating for a psychiatric injury/sleep dysfunction that is a compensable consequence of\n",
      "¹ All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise noted.\n",
      "3\n",
      "a physical injury occurring on or after January 1, 2013. (Kris Wilson v. State of California - Cal\n",

      "v. Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (Montenegro) (2016 W/D) 81 Cal.Comp.Cases 611.)\n",
      "Therefore, the issue of whether applicant's psychiatric condition and sleep disorder are a direct\n",
      "result of the October 8, 2013 incident, or whether they are the consequence of the orthopedic\n",
      "injuries, must be determined. Once that issue is resolved, the issue of whether the provisions of\n",
      "section 4660.1 are applicable in this matter can be addressed.\n",
      "Although it appears that Dr. Nehorayan concluded applicant's psychiatric condition was\n",
      "caused by the October 8, 2013 incident, he did not explain the reasoning or analysis that was the\n",
      "basis for his opinion. Also, review of Dr. Navab's report indicates that he did not address the issue\n",
      "of whether applicant's sleep disorder was a direct result of the October 8, 2013 incident, or whether\n",
      "it was a consequence of the orthopedic injuries. Thus, the doctors' reports are not substantial\n",
      "evidence regarding the issues discussed herein.\n",
      "It is well established that any award, order, or decision of the Appeals Board must be\n",
      "supported by substantial evidence. (Lab. Code, § 5952(d); Lamb v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd.\n",
      "(1974) 11 Cal.3d 274, 281 [39 Cal.Comp.Cases 310]; Garza v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd.\n",
      "(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317 [35 Cal.Comp.Cases 500].) The Appeals Board has the discretionary\n",
      "authority to develop the record when the medical record is not substantial evidence or where there\n",
      "is insufficient evidence to determine an issue that was submitted for decision. (Lab. Code, §5701,\n",
      "5906; Tyler v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 389 [62 Cal.Comp.Cases 924];\n",

      "Cal.Comp.Cases 261].) Clearly, the issue of permanent disability caused by the October 8, 2013\n",
      "injury is a threshold issue in this matter, and in order to determine that issue the record must be\n",
      "further developed.\n",
      "When the medical record requires further development, the record should first be\n",
      "supplemented by physicians who have already reported in the case. (See McDuffie v. Los Angeles\n",

      "Under these circumstances, upon return of this matter we recommend that the parties request Dr.\n",

      "At trial, defendant's supervisor, Juan Saragosa, testified as follows:\n",
      "Q. BY MS. HOFFMAN: So with respect to the Santa Monica project, employees\n",
      "were given a stipend for gas; is that correct?\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER: A what for gas?\n",
      "Q. BY MS. HOFFMAN: They were given money for gas?\n",
      "A. Yes. I believe I [sic] was $125 or something like that.\n",

      "THE WITNESS: Yes, that is correct. At the beginning of the project, the company\n",
      "told us that they were going to pay us a one-time $125 to get there and come back,\n",
      "and they said that if we wanted to drive back and forth during the middle of the\n",
      "project, then that would be our own expense.\n",
      "(Id., pp.13:13-24, 18:6-18, 19:10-15.)\n",
      "Q. So looking at the payments made to David beginning June 1st of 2018, and going\n",
      "forward from there, he was working every week until he died; is that correct?\n",
      "A. Yes, from page 3 to 4, it shows him working 70 every week.\n",
      "Q. Now, I believe, Mr. Saragosa, that you testified when Ms. Hoffman was asking\n",
      "you questions that Bayview always had jobs going on around California; is that\n",
      "correct?\n",
      "A. Yes. Well, at that time, there were only new projects in Santa Monica, so the\n",
      "majority of the projects were in the Bay Area. There were a lot of projects going\n",
      "on, yes.\n",

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "To address defendant's contention that the witness testimony shown in the trial transcript\n",
      "demonstrates that the commercial traveler rule is inapplicable, we examine whether applicant's\n",
      "activity at the time of his injury was one that defendant could \"reasonably expect to be incident to\n",
      "its requirement that [applicant] spend time away from home.\" (IBM Corp. v. Workers' Comp.\n",
      "Appeals Bd. (Korpela) (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 279, 283 [43 Cal.Comp.Cases 161].) In particular,\n",
      "we examine whether applicant's weekend travel was within the course of employment or a non-\n",
      "compensable \"distinct departure on a personal errand.\" (Korpela, supra, at p. 283.)\n",
      "Here, we previously found that the record shows that (1) defendant's employees who\n",
      "resided in the Bay Area and worked on its Santa Monica project would return to the Bay Area for\n",
      "a weekend or a Sunday; (2) defendant made lodging available for its employees based in the Bay\n",
      "Area without expecting the employees to stay in the lodging all seven nights of the week; (3)\n",
      "3\n",
      "applicant advised defendant that he would be traveling to the Bay Area on the morning of Saturday,\n",
      "July 28, 2018, after work on the Santa Monica project halted unexpectedly until the following\n",
      "Monday; and (4) defendant expected employees such as applicant who resided in the Bay Area to\n",
      "travel there during time off of their work on the Santa Monica project. (Opinion and Decision\n",
      "After Reconsideration, March 4, 2021, pp. 4-5.) Based upon this record, we concluded that\n",
      "applicant sustained injury while engaged in an activity which defendant reasonably expected to be\n",
      "incident to its requirement that he spend time away from home on its Santa Monica project—and\n",
      "not while engaged in a distinct departure from his employment. (Id.,\n",
      "p. 5.)\n",
      "As to the trial transcript, we note that defendant's supervisor, Mr. Saragosa, testified that\n",
      "employees residing in the Bay Area and working on the Santa Monica project were permitted to\n",
      "\"drive back and forth during the middle of the project,\" and that he was personally aware that\n",
      "applicant would stay in Santa Monica on some weekends and return to the Bay Area on others.\n",
      "(Reporter's Transcript of Hearing, August 4, 2020, p. 19:10-15; 26:4-13.)\n",
      "Thus, we are persuaded that the trial transcript provides additional evidence that applicant's\n",
      "injury occurred while he was engaged in travel which defendant reasonably expected to be incident\n",
      "to its requirement that he spend time away from his residence while working on its Santa Monica\n",
      "project and not while he was engaged in a distinct departure from his employment.\n",
      "Accordingly, we will affirm our Opinion and Decision After Reconsideration issued on\n",
      "March 4, 2021.\n",
      "Having determined the merits of the Petition, we nevertheless address applicant's requests\n",

      "of Mr. Ledesma and Mr. Saragosa.\n",
      "Mr. Saragosa was the Supervisor of a project to remove\n",
      "asbestos from a high school in Santa Monica. Decedent was one of\n",
      "the workers on the project. . . [who] resided in the San Francisco\n",

      "determined that insufficient progress was being made, and the\n",
      "employees were put on a six day a week work schedule.\n",
      "The employer provided the employees who were from the\n",
      "San Francisco Bay Area with a lump sum payment of $125.00 to\n",
      "cover one roundtrip from the Bay Area to Santa Monica. While the\n",
      "project was in process, the employer provided for lodging for the\n",
      "employees at a Motel 6. The lodging was available, and generally\n",
      "paid for, on a seven days per week basis. If a worker left the motel\n",
      "for a night or two, the employer notified the motel and asked for a\n",
      "rebate. The worker would have to re-register upon returning to the\n",
      "motel. In addition, the employer provided a $20.00 per day stipend\n",

      "this allowance was only made during days worked, or days spent at\n",

      "The workers who lived in the Bay Area sometimes returned\n",

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "A \"commercial traveler is regarded as acting within the course of his\n",
      "employment during the entire period of his travel upon his employer's business.\"\n",
      "(Wiseman v. Industrial Acc. Comm. (1956) 46 Cal.2d 570, 572 [21\n",
      "Cal.Comp.Cases 192].) The Supreme Court has made clear that, “[i]n the case\n",
      "of a commercial traveler, workers' compensation coverage applies to the travel\n",
      "itself and also to other aspects of the trip reasonably necessary for the\n",
      "sustenance, comfort, and safety of the employee.\" (LaTourette v. Workers'\n",
      "Comp. Appeals Bd. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 644, 652 [63 Cal.Comp.Cases 253].) As\n",
      "the Court of Appeal observed, an employee away on business can “hardly [be]\n",
      "expected to remain holed up in his hotel room.\" (Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. v.\n",
      "Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (Moody) (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1316, 1327 [70\n",
      "Cal.Comp.Cases 1659].)\n",
      "The test is whether the activity during the injury is one “that an employer\n",
      "may reasonably expect to be incident to its requirement that an employee spend\n",
      "time away from home.\" (IBM Corp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (Korpela)\n",
      "(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 279, 283 [43 Cal.Comp.Cases 161].) This rule is\n",
      "construed liberally in favor of injured employees. (Korpela, supra, at p. 282\n",
      "(citing Labor Code section 3202).)\n",
      "In Korpela, the issue presented was whether an employee's death from an\n",
      "automobile accident while on a weekend trip to visit relatives during the course\n",
      "of an out-of-town training program was compensable under the commercial\n",
      "traveler rule. Evaluating whether the weekend trip was within the course of\n",
      "employment or a non-compensable \"distinct departure on a personal errand,” the\n",
      "court found that the weekend trip was a leisure time activity normally incident\n",
      "to an out-of-town temporary assignment, a conclusion further supported by the\n",
      "fact that the employee's supervisor knew of the visit and encouraged it.\n",
      "(Korpela, supra, at p. 283.)\n",
      "Similarly, in Hanford Cmty. Med. Ctr. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 81\n",
      "Cal.Comp.Cases 1039, 2016 Cal. Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 118 (writ den.), the Court\n",
      "9\n",
      "of Appeal upheld the WCAB's finding that an employee's accidental death\n",
      "while traveling from his Fresno home to attend the second day of an off-site\n",
      "conference in Pismo Beach after having departed the conference the previous\n",
      "day to be home with his daughter who had just given birth was compensable\n",
      "under the \"commercial traveler\" doctrine. (See Skubitz v. Hanford Community\n",
      "Hosp., 2016 Cal. Wrk. Comp. P.D. LEXIS 168, pp. 18-20.)\n",
      "Here, as stated by the Report, the record shows that defendant's workers\n",
      "who resided in the Bay Area and worked on its project in Santa Monica would\n",
      "return to the Bay Area for a weekend or a Sunday. (Report, p. 4.) Defendant's\n",
      "supervisor, Mr. Saragosa, testified that he himself returned to the Bay Area\n",
      "approximately five or six times during the duration of the project. (Id.)\n",
      "Further, defendant made lodging available for its employees based in the\n",
      "Bay Area without expecting the employees to stay in the lodging all seven nights\n",
      "of the week. (See Id., pp. 3-4.) In particular, defendant would seek a rebate\n",
      "whenever an employee chose not to stay in the lodging for one or two nights.\n",
      "(Id., p. 4.)\n",
      "Further, applicant advised defendant that he would be traveling to the Bay\n",
      "Area on the morning of Saturday, July 28, 2018, after work on the project came\n",
      "to an unexpected halt until the following Monday. (Id., p. 4.)\n",
      "Thus, the record reveals that applicant's travel to the Bay Area during his\n",
      "time off was a practice which defendant expected of its employees; and, more\n",
      "specifically, that defendant's supervisor knew of applicant's travel on the\n",
      "weekend of his death. (Report, pp. 4, 7.) Notably, defendant's supervisor did\n",
      "not object to applicant's travel as a deviation from his employment, but merely\n",
      "cautioned him as a \"friend\" that the travel would be tiring. (Id., p. 7.) It follows\n",
      "that applicant sustained injury while engaged in an activity which defendant\n",
      "reasonably expected to be incident to its requirement that applicant spend time\n",
      "away from home on its Santa Monica project and not while engaged in a\n",
      "distinct departure from his employment.\n",
      "Accordingly, we will rescind the F&O, substitute new findings that\n",

      "opinions regarding impairment and apportionment, Dr. Ryan had clearly previously determined\n",

      "Defendant acknowledged the reasonableness and necessity of [the medical\n",

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "We note that pursuant to Labor Code³ section 5909, a petition for reconsideration is\n",
      "generally considered denied by operation of law if the Appeals Board does not act on the petition\n",
      "within 60 days of filing. (Lab. Code, § 5909.) However, “it is a fundamental principle of due\n",
      "process that a party may not be deprived of a substantial right without notice (Shipley v.\n",
      "Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1104, 1108 [57 Cal.Comp.Cases 493].) In\n",
      "Shipley, the Appeals Board denied the applicant's petition reconsideration because the Appeals\n",
      "Board had not acted on the petition within the statutory time limits of section 5909. (Lab. Code,\n",
      "§ 5909.) This occurred because the Appeals Board had misplaced the file, through no fault of the\n",
      "parties. The Court of Appeal reversed the Appeals Board's decision, holding that the time to act\n",
      "on applicant's petition was tolled during the period that the file was misplaced. (Shipley, supra, at\n",
      "1108.) Like the Court in Shipley, \"we are not convinced that the burden of the system's\n",
      "inadequacies should fall on [a party].\" In this case, the Appeals Board failed to act on applicant's\n",
      "Petition within 60 days of its filing on August 11, 2021, through no fault of the parties. Therefore,\n",
      "considering that the Appeals Board's failure to act on the Petition was in error we find that our\n",
      "time to act on the Petition was tolled.\n",

      "All further statutory references are to the Labor Code, unless otherwise noted.\n",

      "amend any order, decision, or award, good cause appearing therefor.\"4 (Lab. Code, § 5803.)\n",

      "(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 929, 935.) For a compromise and release agreement to be effective, the\n",
      "necessary elements of a contract must exist, including an offer of settlement of a disputed claim\n",
      "by one of the parties, and an acceptance by the other. (Id.) There can be no contract unless there is\n",
      "a meeting of the minds and the parties mutually agree upon the same thing. (Civ. Code, §§ 1550,\n",
      "1565, 1580; Sackett v. Starr (1949) 95 Cal.App.2d 128; Sieck v. Hall (1934) 139 Cal.App.279,\n",
      "291; American Can Co. v. Agricultural Ins. Co. (1909) 12 Cal.App. 133, 137.) Stipulations\n",
      "between the parties must be interpreted to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties it existed\n",

      "being settled, specifically applicant claims that there was no mention of \"trunk\" as a body part\n",
      "prior to its inclusion in the C&R. However, the limited evidentiary record bars a meaningful review\n",

      "disability, account shall be taken of the nature of the physical injury or\n",
      "disfigurement, the occupation of the injured employee, and his or her age at the\n",
      "time of the injury, consideration being given to an employee's diminished future\n",

      "by which the schedule rating could be rebutted. (Oglivie v. Workers' Comp.\n",
      "Appeals Bd. (2011) 197 Cal. App. 4th.) The primary method for rebutting the\n",
      "scheduled rating is based upon a determination that the injured worker is not\n",
      "amendable to rehabilitation and, for that reason, the employee's diminished\n",
      "future earning capacity is greater than reflected in the scheduled rating. The\n",
      "employee's diminished future earnings must be directly attributable to the\n",
      "employee's work-related injury and not due to nonindustrial factors such as\n",
      "general economic conditions, illiteracy, proficiency in spealdng English, or an\n",
      "employee's lack of education. (Ogilvie, 197 Cal. App. 4th.)\n",
      "5\n",
      "In Dahl, the Court of Appeal held that to rebut the scheduled rating, applicant\n",
      "must prove that the industrial injury precludes vocational rehabilitation, writing\n",
      "in salient\n",
      "part as follows:\n",
      "The first step in any LeBoeuf analysis is to determine whether a\n",
      "work-related injury precludes the claimant from taking advantage of\n",
      "vocational rehabilitation and participating in the labor force. This\n",
      "necessarily requires an individualized approach. It is this\n",
      "individualized assessment of whether industrial factors preclude the\n",
      "employee's rehabilitation that Ogilvie approved as a method for\n",
      "rebutting the schedule. (Dahl, 80 Cal. Comp. Cases at 1128,)\n",
      "Here, the court relied on the vocational evidence from Mr. Greenberg to\n",
      "determine that the applicant is not amenable to vocational rehabilitation and the\n",
      "medical work restrictions preclude full time employment. The comprehensive\n",
      "vocational assessment offered by Mr. Greenberg relies upon his own objective\n",

      "based on work restrictions.\" (Petition, p.21, lines 8-9.)\n",
      "This court disagrees. Here, Dr. Zwerin initially issued a whole person\n",

      "Primarily, it is important to note that Dr. Zwerin's finding of 15% apportionment\n",

      "The WCJ found injury to the lumbar spine on both a cumulative trauma\n",
      "and specific injury basis. Within Dr. Hascall's December 5, 2020 report he finds\n",
      "the applicant's diagnosis of hypertension and sleep were potentially secondary\n",
      "to obesity. (Joint Exhibit “AA” Page 7). He further noted that if there was a\n",
      "considerable injury involving the low back dating back to 2001, which is prior\n",
      "to his weight gain then 100% would be apportioned to his weight gain secondary\n",

      "symptoms. (However, based upon the applicant's credible testimony and the\n",
      "entire record, the WCJ does not find that the applicant's 2001 back injury caused\n",
      "Applicant's obesity.).\n",
      "Agreed Medical Evaluator Steven Silbart, M.D. issued an Orthopedic\n",
      "medical report dated September 30, 2016 wherein he found that causation/\n",

      "Defendant alleges the testimony at trial is not consistent with the medical\n",
      "records and the applicant's deposition testimony. However, the deposition, nor\n",
      "any portion of the deposition were admitted in evidence. Thus, the alleged\n",

      "apportionment of hypertension and sleep hinges on the issue of applicant's\n",
      "\"ability to perform his work and decreased ability to exert himself\" subsequent\n",
      "to his lumbar spine injury in 2001.\n",
      "Within Dr. Hascall's 54-page PQME Internal Medicine report, dated\n",
      "March 21, 2016, the doctor noted there were issues regarding Applicant's\n",
      "hypertension and sleep apnea, which were potentially secondary to Applicant's\n",
      "obesity, which would be secondary to his low back pain and decreased ability to\n",

      "he sustained the injury to the back affecting his ability to perform his work and\n",

      "The WCJ finds the applicant's testimony and the entire record support that\n",

      "injury to the multiple body parts and his discontinuing to work in 2012.\n",
      "Applicant's testimony was that he continued to be active working in the\n",
      "warehouse up to the time he was required to stop working due to shoulder pain.\n",
      "Regarding taking Dr. Hascall's deposition or obtaining additional\n",
      "reporting, the WCJ finds there is insufficient evidence to prove that the 2001\n",

      "himself to support Dr. Hascall to find that the 2001 date of injury was a\n",
      "causative factor, and not the cumulative trauma injury. Further, the reporting of\n",
      "Dr. Silbart gives no impairment for the 2001 specific injury, but apportions the\n",

      "defendant continued to deny there was actually a 2001 injury up to the time of\n",

      "6\n",
      "Defendant contents that if the sleep apnea and hypertension started around\n",
      "2005, then logically they must have been caused by something that preceded\n",

      "Medical Evaluator Silbart did not give any impairment for the specific injury.\n",
      "Applicant testified the cumulative trauma of the heavy work to his job eventually\n",
      "caused his disability and Agreed Medical Evaluator Silbart so found the\n",

      "specific injury. Applicant's credible testimony and Dr. Silbart's reporting\n",

      "of August 1, 2019 reflect that the parties stipulated, as to the specific injury of November 2, 1994\n",
      "(ADJ946031), that “applicant's overall permanent disability is 100 percent prior to\n",
      "apportionment,\" with the issues of permanent disability and apportionment being raised in both\n",

      "in two ways: (1) between the two industrial injuries; and (2) to non-industrial \"other factors\" under\n",
      "Labor Code section 4663.\n",
      "We also note that the WCJ's Opinion on Decision includes some confusing statements on\n",
      "permanent disability and apportionment. Referring to the two specific industrial injuries, the WCJ\n",
      "states, “[i]t is because of all of the injuries combined that applicant is 100% totally temporarily\n",
      "disabled on a permanent basis.\" (Italics added.) Referring to Dr. Mandell's opinion on\n",
      "apportionment, the WCJ then states, “[s]ince it is the synergistic effect of all body parts injured\n",
      "that caused applicant's total disability, apportioning each body part separately [as attempted by\n",
      "Dr. Mandell] does not calculate.\" In the former statement, the WCJ seems to confuse temporary\n",
      "and permanent disability, while referring to the combined effects of applicant's injuries. In the\n",
      "latter statement, the WCJ refers to the synergistic effects of the injured body parts as a reason for\n",
      "rejecting Dr. Mandell's apportionment. However, this may not be a valid reason for disallowing\n",
      "apportionment if the combined injuries resulted in permanent and total disability, per the WCJ's\n",
      "former statement referred to above. We conclude the WCJ must revisit and clarify her approach\n",
      "to resolving the issue of apportionment in both case numbers.\n",
      "In addition, we note the WCJ's Opinion on Decision disallows apportionment based on\n",
      "non-industrial factors, and between the two injuries. At the same time, it appears the WCJ issued\n",
      "a joint Award against both employers, National Courier Systems and the City of Oakland, but\n",
      "without apportioning liability between them. This is contrary to Benson v. Workers' Comp.\n",

      "Appeals Bd. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1535 [74 Cal.Comp.Cases 113]. In Benson, the Court of\n",

      "mandates that multiple injuries ordinarily require separate permanent disability awards. However,\n",
      "the Court also stated that \"there may be limited circumstances...when the evaluating physician\n",

      "In this case, the WCJ rejected apportionment between injuries notwithstanding Dr.\n",
      "Mandell's having done so in his deposition. (Joint Exhibit 102, pp. 21-26.) Further, the WCJ\n",

      "industrial injury to his heart and in the form of hypertension causing permanent disability of 29%\n",
      "after apportionment.\n",
      "Applicant contends that the WCJ erred in finding permanent disability of only 29% arguing\n",
      "that his injuries constitute presumptive heart trouble pursuant to Labor Code section 3212.2 and\n",
      "are thus exempt from apportionment pursuant to Labor Code section 4663(e).\n",

      "Labor Code section 3212.2 states, in pertinent part:\n",
      "In the case of officers and employees in the Department of Corrections having\n",
      "custodial duties ... the term “injury\" includes heart trouble which develops or\n",
      "manifests itself during a period while such officer or employee is in the service\n",
      "of such department or hospital.\n",
      "The compensation which is awarded for such heart trouble shall include full\n",
      "hospital, surgical, medical treatment, disability indemnity, and death benefits, as\n",
      "provided by the workmen's compensation laws of this state.\n",
      "Such heart trouble so developing or manifesting itself in such cases shall be\n",
      "presumed to arise out of and in the course of the employment. This presumption\n",
      "is disputable and may be controverted by other evidence, but unless so\n",
      "controverted, the appeals board is bound to find in accordance with it. This\n",
      "presumption shall be extended to a member following termination of service for\n",
      "a period of three calendar months for each full year of the requisite service, but\n",
      "not to exceed 60 months in any circumstance, commencing with the last date\n",
      "actually worked in the specified capacity.\n",
      "Thus, under the statute, any heart trouble that \"develops or manifests itself\" during a\n",
      "correctional officer's service or the statutory time after service has ended is entitled to the\n",
      "presumption. Here, qualified medical evaluator internist Stanley J. Machjer, M.D. testified that\n",
      "applicant's heart trouble developed during applicant's period of service beginning in 2012.\n",
      "(October 12, 2021 deposition at pp. 7-8.) Thus, applicant's heart trouble developed during\n",

      "invoke the WCAB's jurisdiction by filing an Application for Adjudication of Claim during his\n",
      "period of service, or within 18 months of his last date of service. ¹ However, the time limits in\n",

      "applicant files suit, which is governed by the statute of limitations, an entirely different legal\n",
      "principle. Here, applicant's heart trouble developed while he was actually in service, rendering\n",
      "the additional 18 months in which the heart trouble could have manifested itself moot.\n",
      "Since applicant's injury is subject to the section 3212.2 heart trouble presumption, pursuant\n",

      "It was Dr. Ganzhorn's opinion that due to the general 15-year latency period for\n",

      "in deposition that exposure to the red rags \"was pretty much the only asbestos exposure that we\n",
      "could figure. So...it seems reasonable to me that this is how it happened, but...unfortunately, all we\n",

      "decedent told his treating pulmonologist, Dr. Van Gundy, that the red rags were used to wipe the\n",

      "Dr. Ganzhorn testified that in 90% of mesothelioma cases, the latency period is 15 years or more, although it can be\n",

      "December 17, 2016. (Joint Exh. A3, p. 1.)³\n",
      "QME Dr. Ganzhorn also testified in deposition that although he could not cite to a specific\n",
      "medical or industrial journal, “it is pretty much common knowledge that in the past, brake shoes\n",
      "were - contained asbestos. Currently they don't.” (Joint Exh. A2, p. 12.) Dr. Ganzhorn could not\n",
      "cite to a specific study related to the rates of auto shop mechanics who are diagnosed with\n",
      "mesothelioma, although he did recall studies that undermined the credibility of studies \"that\n",
      "purport to show that X, Y, or Z occupation has no increased incidence of mesothelioma.” (Id., at\n",
      "p. 20.) He was \"pretty confident\" that there are no studies related to workers who pick up rags used\n",
      "to wipe out brakes and their rate of mesothelioma. (Id., at p. 21.) Given the low incidence rate of\n",
      "mesothelioma of about 3,000 cases per year in the United States, studies involving mesothelioma\n",
      "are difficult. (Ibid.) People contract mesothelioma in strange ways, including just standing around\n",
      "another person doing work with asbestos containing products. (Ibid.) Dr. Ganzhorn has “seen\n",

      "Dr. Ganzhorn did not have any independent knowledge of when the transition was made\n",
      "from using asbestos in brake linings, to not using asbestos. (Joint Exh. A2, p. 12.) Dr. Ganzhorn\n",
      "has reviewed \"a lot of mesothelioma cases,” and based on his prior review of testimony in other\n",
      "such cases, he generally knows that there was asbestos in brake shoes. (Id., p. 13.) However, in\n",
      "those other cases, “they wouldn't rely on a clinical pulmonologist to tell you the answer to that\n",

      "years asbestos was used in brake linings. (Ibid.) Dr. Ganzhorn knows that brake shoes contained\n",
      "asbestos in the past, but would defer to a \"product person\" to say which type of asbestos was in\n",
      "brake shoes. (Id., at p. 35.) Dr. Ganzhorn hoped that the parties \"goes and buys an industrial\n",

      "development of mesothelioma is \"any exposure to asbestos fibers above background...\" (Joint Exh.\n",
      "A2, p. 33.) In relation to decedent's alleged exposure to asbestos, Dr. Ganzhorn testified as follows:\n",
      "3 The deposition of Craig McDonald, dated August 24, 2108, was not produced by either party or admitted into\n",
      "evidence.\n",
      "5\n",
      "A. We have no idea exactly how many rags that Mr. Oakes picked up and\n",
      "brought back to the shop after brakes were wiped, actually contained asbestos.\n",
      "But I think it is a safe bet that over this period of years, when he was picking up\n",
      "rags that were used to wipe out brakes, that a number of them had asbestos on\n",
      "them. He breathed in the asbestos fibers, and that is how he ended up with\n",
      "mesothelioma and dying from mesothelioma.\n",
      "Q. Well, in terms of the actual exposure, assuming that the red rags did have\n",
      "asbestos on them, do you have an opinion as to the frequency or the regularity\n",
      "as to the number of rags that would need to be -- he would need to be exposed\n",
      "to and on what period, what year of exposure or years of exposure would.be\n",
      "necessary to contribute to the mesothelioma?\n",
      "A. You know, I don't think I have any scientific way of answering that question.\n",
      "Q. Would it have to be sort of a daily exposure? Would it have to be once a\n",
      "month if he picked up the rags? Do you have any kind of benchmark that we can\n",
      "go off of?\n",
      "A. Well, I think any exposure to asbestos above background exposure would be\n",
      "thought of in this case as being causal for his malignant mesothelioma.\n",
      "Q. Okay. And, again, assuming that he did pick up red rags that would have\n",
      "asbestos on them, did it occur once a month where he went to auto shops and\n",
      "picked them up? Would that be sufficient exposure?\n",
      "A. I don't think there is any scientific way to answer that question. I think we\n",
      "would be speculating. I mean, I think the guy I think the guy picked up rags\n",
      "that had asbestos on them. I don't know if he did it every day, twice a day, once\n",
      "a month, every day except Sunday. I don't know. All I know is what it says here\n",
      "in this deposition of Mrs. Oakes.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: Okay. Now, if you were to look at the last couple lines in my\n",
      "history of present illness, occupational history, page 5, it says that the workers\n",
      "at the auto shop would, quote, take the rags after they were done with them and\n",
      "throw them in a corner or a box or a pail, and Mr. Oakes would have to go pick\n",
      "them up, count them, put them in a sack, put them back in his truck and he had\n",
      "to count them, because he had to bring so many back.\n",
      "A. So that means to me that it seems likely that there was quite a few of these\n",
      "rags.\n",
      "6\n",
      "A. In the information that I got, here, the main asbestos exposure that Mr. Oakes\n",
      "told his pulmonary doc about was these red rags.\n",
      "Q. It also -- it would be fair to conclude that we don't know the nature and extent\n",
      "of his exposure, at least at this time?\n",
      "A. Well, you know, we were not there.\n",
      "A. But it seems reasonable that he was exposed to asbestos -- reasonable to me,\n",
      "that he was exposed to asbestos picking up these rags that were used to wipe\n",
      "brakes.\n",
      "A. And transporting them back to Aramark and also Valley Industrial Services.\n",
      "So, I mean, I think – I think likely since this happened over a period of a number\n",
      "of years, he was exposed to asbestos, you know, considerably. I mean, not as\n",
      "much as an insulator or a pipefitter, but I think he was exposed to asbestos over\n",
      "a 31 year period of time. And he got mesothelioma. And this is the only thing\n",
      "we can really point to that would have caused his mesothelioma. (Id., at pp. 14-\n",

      "Based on this evidence, the WCJ found that decedent sustained an injury arising out of and\n",

      "in the course of his employment with defendant to his lungs as a result of exposure to asbestos and\n",
      "ultimately, death from that exposure. (Findings, Opinion on Decision, pp. 1-2.) This finding of fact\n",
      "was based on the unrebutted and credible testimony of Mr. McDonald and Mrs. Dresser-Oakes\n",

      "Evidence, 9/28/21). However, the parties took the deposition of Dr. Fonseca on\n",

      "of 12/4/19, Petitioner did not mention that he had a preexisting back injury (Page\n",

      "further testified that his supervisor Rossana attempted to crack his back using a\n",

      "Petitioner testified that he did not have any symptoms in his low back prior to\n",
      "working at Volutone (Shireson Bros). He changed that testimony to reflect that\n",
      "had some back pain here and there prior to working for the employer, but that\n",
      "he never had a low back injury prior to working there (SOE, page 2, lines 9-11).\n",
      "He also testified that he did not have back pain as a result of his injury in 2011,\n",
      "but after being confronted with the reporting of Dr. Silver who evaluated him\n",
      "for the 2011 injury, he admitted that he had low back pain at that time (SOE,\n",

      "The Court issued a Joint Findings and Take Nothing Order on 4/6/22\n",

      "basis for the decision was that Petitioner did not meet his burden due to a lack\n",
      "of substantial evidence as well as Petitioner's highly questionable credibility.\n",
      "III\n",
      "6\n",
      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "LACK OF SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE\n",
      "Labor Code section 5705 states that \"The burden of proof rests upon the\n",

      "that he didn't meet his burden.\n",
      "Contrary to Petitioner's assertion, the Court did not rely on any medical\n",
      "evidence in its determination. The determination was made based on a lack of\n",
      "substantial evidence to support Petitioner's burden of proof.\n",
      "Petitioner appears to argue that substantial evidence exists in the form of\n",
      "reports from Dr. Fonseca. But those reports were not offered into evidence. It\n",
      "appears that the report dated 8/27/20 was obtained after the closure of discovery,\n",
      "but again, it was not offered into evidence.\n",
      "DUTY TO DEVELOP THE RECORD\n",
      "Although it is well settled that the Court has a duty to develop the medical\n",
      "record when there is no substantial evidence on which a decision can be based,\n",
      "it has also been held that the duty to develop the medical record should not be\n",

      "a claim.² In this case, Applicant failed to tell either of the examining physicians\n",
      "in this case about his prior back injury in 2011. Additionally, Applicant denied\n",
      "any such injury at the time of trial until he was confronted with said records.\n",
      "Thus, this is exactly the type of situation where it would be improper to develop\n",
      "the medical record to rescue the Applicant.\n",
      "Petitioner has asserted that the Court declined to review Dr. Fonseca's\n",

      "of Evidence \"MOH/SOE” at p. 2). The claim is denied. (Defendant Exhibit\n",
      "\"A\"). This claim stems from several events at work that led to Applicant's\n",
      "psychiatric injury to wit: 1) denial of a promotion to HR Analyst IV in 2016; 2)\n",
      "being characterized as racist at work; 3) a negative performance evaluation; and\n",
      "4) failure to secure a promotion to Assistant Administrator. The latter of these\n",
      "three events all occurred subsequent to what became known as the\n",
      "'whistleblowing letter' discussed infra.\n",
      "At trial, Applicant testified that he was hired in September of 2009.\n",
      "(MOH/SOE at p. 4:6-7). The parties stipulated that Applicant was employed\n",
      "during the period September 21, 2009 to February 12, 2020, by County of Los\n",
      "Angeles, Department of Regional Planning. (Id. at p. 2:6-8). Applicant testified\n",
      "that his psychiatric injury began in approximately 2017 after he was passed over\n",
      "for a position.¹ (Id. at 4:9-16). The position was offered to Ms. Hayward even\n",
      "though he had scored higher on the exam. Id. He also testified that Ms. Hayward\n",
      "obtained the position even before the examination. (Id. at p. 4:17-18). His\n",
      "supervisor at the time, Robert Meyers, informed him that Ms. Hayward would\n",
      "be promoted even if she had not taken the exam. (Applicant Exhibit 1, at p. 4).\n",
      "After this event, he had difficulty sleeping, felt doomed, stressed, and unable to\n",
      "focus at work. (Id. at p. 5:13-14). Next, he testified that he attended a regional\n",
      "planning meeting and felt uncomfortable with some of the proposed\n",
      "1 Although the position was not described during testimony, based on review of the records, the undersigned notes\n",
      "the position in question was for HR Analyst IV.\n",
      "3\n",
      "management practices. (Id. at p. 5:19-20). Mark Ridley Thomas was being\n",
      "termed out of political office and each department was asked to hire two to three\n",
      "of his staff contrary to civil service rules. (Id. at p. 5:20-22). Applicant and other\n",
      "managers objected to the hiring of political appointees since it undermines the\n",
      "civil service system. (Id. at p. 5:23-25).\n",
      "After this meeting, he sent a letter to the Director of Personnel, Mr. Larson,\n",
      "and his supervisor, Joseph Horvath, explaining why this hiring process was\n",
      "unfair and weakened the culture of fair play. (Id. at p. 6:6-9).² At about the time\n",
      "of the whistleblowing incident, Applicant was interested in a position for\n",
      "Assistant Administrator that was ranked at a higher salary level. (Id. at p. 6:10-\n",
      "12). He believes that after the whistleblowing letter, he lost the support of his\n",
      "supervisor, Mr. Horvath, for this position. Mr. Horvath told him that the CEO\n",
      "yelled, that the Director of the Department, Amy Bodeck, was angry and would\n",
      "not support a manager who did not take the county's position. (Id. at p. 6:12-17).\n",
      "He was also informed that the letter was construed as racially motivated. (Id.).\n",
      "He met with Dennis Loven, a deputy director, who tried to convince him\n",
      "that he had no whistleblower protection, and shared with Applicant an\n",
      "experience of someone else who went contrary to the department and was fired.\n",
      "(Id. at p. 7:16-23). He also testified to another meeting with Rodney Collins\n",
      "(manager over multiple divisions) and Michael Stewart (Principal Analyst for\n",
      "the Civil Service Advocacy Division) wherein Mr. Collins explained that he too\n",
      "was a political appointee and a good worker and that while Applicant's letter\n",
      "itself may not have been racially motivated, that there were other instances of\n",
      "racial conduct. (Id. at p. 8:1-6).\n",
      "At trial, the only rebuttal evidence was that of Mr. Horvath who testified\n",
      "that the Assistant Administrator position has always been open and was used for\n",
      "budget purposes. (Id. at p. 10:1-4). He also testified that other departments are\n",
      "not fans of the process of hiring political appointees because he has heard other\n",

      "disability, apportionment and attorney fees should not be awarded on the current\n",
      "findings. While these three items are listed as the crux of the issues presented,\n",
      "the Petition is replete with various other arguments that the undersigned\n",
      "addresses within each section infra.\n",
      "3 Dr. Kauss was a treating physician and found that “actual events of employment clearly are predominant as to all\n",
      "causes combined of the psychiatric injury.\" (Applicant Exhibit \"2\", at p. 20).\n",
      "5\n",
      "I.\n",
      "THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE FINDINGS OF\n",
      "FACT\n",
      "Defendant raised two issues in this regard (a) there was no objective\n",
      "evidence to support a finding of industrial injury;4 (b) Applicant provided\n",
      "inaccurate and inconsistent histories to the various doctors; and (c) Event #1\n",
      "should be excluded based on the statute of limitation. It should be noted that\n",
      "while not argued at any length, Defendant states that Applicant began\n",
      "employment with Department of Regional Planning in 2018.5\n",
      "a. Objective Evidence\n",
      "Defendant argues that Applicant did not provide any objective evidence\n",
      "of harassment, persecution, or defamation for the alleged psychiatric injury\n",
      "relying on Verga v. WCAB, 73 Cal. Comp. Cases 63. In Verga, the issue before\n",
      "the court was whether the disdainful reactions of a supervisor and co-workers to\n",
      "an employee's mistreatment of them constituted actual events of employment.\n",
      "Id. at 64. The evidence at trial showed that the applicant was a difficult person\n",
      "to get along with, impolite, and unpleasant. Id. The court noted that Labor Code\n",
      "section 3208.3 subdivision (b)(1) was enacted to set a higher threshold of\n",
      "compensability for psychiatric injury and that the Legislature disapproved a\n",
      "ruling permitting such benefits based on an employee's subjective misperception\n",
      "that the employment was stressful. Id. at 64-65. This change “in the statutory\n",
      "scheme constituted an intent to require the claimant to establish objective\n",
      "evidence of harassment, persecution, or other such basis for alleged psychiatric\n",
      "injury.\" Id. at 65. In Verga, the court relied largely on testimonial evidence\n",
      "from several witnesses that the applicant was a very difficult employee and\n",
      "upheld the WCJ's finding that the applicant was not actually subject to\n",
      "harassment or persecution, Id. at 69, but rather misperceived as harassment her\n",
      "co-workers' disdainful response to her mistreatment of them. Id.\n",
      "The question thus presented is the definition of objective evidence.\n",
      "Objective evidence refers to evidence that can be externally verified. Objective\n",
      "evidence is not synonymous with tangible evidence. Applicant testified credibly\n",
      "to Events 1, 2, and 4. These Events could be externally verified and Defendant\n",
      "should have presented testimony to rebut Applicant's testimony. It is also noted\n",
      "that at no point did Defendant raise the issue of the validity as to the Events\n",
      "occurring during cross-examination. Instead, Defendant argued at trial and\n",
      "continues to argue in its Petition for Reconsideration that these Events were good\n",
      "faith personnel actions. This case is not like Verga, there is no evidence to\n",
      "4 This issue was summarized under the section \"Argument with Points and Authority\" in Defendant's Petition for\n",
      "Reconsideration.\n",
      "5 The parties stipulated at trial that Applicant was employed by the Department of Regional Planning beginning in\n",
      "2009 as discuss supra. Any efforts to rebut his time in this department should have been raised at the time of trial.\n",
      "Further, even if Applicant changed departments through his employment, the employer remained the same.\n",
      "6\n",
      "suggest that the events of workplace were a result of the Applicant's honest\n",
      "misperception.\n",
      "Objective evidence can also consists of medical records or expert opinion.\n",
      "Objective medical evidence is evidence based on objective symptoms within the\n",
      "knowledge of a doctor in that they are perceptible to persons other than the\n",
      "patient. Here, there is objective medical evidence by both Dr. Kauss and Dr.\n",
      "Nehorayan through medical evaluations and an extensive battery of tests finding\n",
      "that actual events of employment were the substantial cause of Applicant's\n",
      "injury. Therefore, the undersigned finds that Applicant's credible testimony,\n",
      "lack of rebuttal thereof, and medical evidence support that injury was caused by\n",
      "actual events of employment.\n",
      "b. Inaccurate and Inconsistent Histories\n",
      "6\n",
      "Defendant argues that Applicant provided inaccurate and inconsistent\n",
      "testimony when he told Dr. Kauss that despite being thwarted in his attempts for\n",
      "a promotion, there were good promotion opportunities at the County of Los\n",
      "Angeles purportedly contradicting what he told Dr. Nehorayan. Defendant also\n",
      "argues that while Applicant testified that Dr. Sherrill did not want to hear about\n",
      "events prior to when he went on leave, that Dr. Sherrill testified in her deposition\n",
      "that she felt it would be important to be provided with further information\n",
      "regarding the alleged whistleblowing activities.\n",
      "The undersigned disagrees that the record is inconsistent or inaccurate in\n",
      "this regard. The statement in the report of Dr. Kauss was that \"Mr. Larson\n",
      "reports that there were good promotional opportunities, but that he was thwarted\n",
      "in his attempts to promote.\" This statement is consistent with his testimony at\n",
      "trial and that given to all the doctors. With respect to the claims of inconsistent\n",
      "statements to Dr. Sherrill, Applicant was not present at Dr. Sherrill's deposition\n",
      "and what she said to the Applicant at the evaluation is not refuted by a\n",
      "subsequent deposition. Finally, the fact that Applicant was later offered a\n",
      "promotion opportunity does not in and of itself negate Event #1.\n",
      "c. Event #1 is Barred by the Statute of Limitation\n",
      "Several events during one period of cumulative trauma may be combined\n",
      "to determine whether the predominant cause requirement is met. The appeals\n",

      "and that estoppel does not apply belongs to the employer. Sidders v. WCAB, 53\n",
      "Cal. Comp Cases, 445. Additionally, the statute of limitations defense must be\n",
      "specifically raised by the employer and does not apply automatically even if its\n",

      "extensive discussion of Labor Code section 5405 or Reynolds v. WCAB, 12 Cal.\n",
      "3d 726 is not warranted. Defendant did not raise this affirmative defense at trial\n",

      "DEFENDANT MET ITS BURDEN OF PROOF OF LAWFUL\n",
      "NON- DISCRIMINATORY GOOD FAITH PERSONNEL\n",
      "ACTION\n",
      "Defendant further argues that it met its burden of proof that Events 1-3,\n",
      "were lawful non- discriminatory good faith personnel actions. For Event #1,\n",
      "Defendant argues that there was no evidence of personnel records to explain why\n",
      "the Applicant did not receive the promotion or that the promoted candidate did\n",
      "not score as well. This argument appears to be a recitation of the argument\n",
      "related to objective evidence discussed supra. Suffice it to state that it would be\n",
      "highly unlikely that Applicant would have been able to obtain records of another\n",
      "employee not a party to this case even if he requested it. Moreover, Defendant\n",
      "was best suited to provide that rebuttal evidence at trial through exhibits or\n",
      "testimony but failed to do so. Defendant's statement that its witness provided\n",
      "testimony that County procedures regarding hiring were followed is distorted.\n",
      "Defendant's witness, Mr. Horvath, did not rebut any of the Applicant's\n",
      "testimony related to Event #1. Instead, his testimony regarding the hiring and\n",
      "promotion was a general response to a question by the court as outlined supra.\n",
      "Defendant argues that it successfully rebutted Event #2 as related to\n",
      "Applicant being blocked for a promotion within his current department as this\n",
      "was rebutted by Mr. Horvath who testified that the position had not been open\n",
      "for recruitment. Defendant appears to have mixed up Event 2 with Event 4. The\n",
      "undersigned did find that Event #4 related to the failure to hire Applicant to the\n",
      "position of Assistant Administrator was successfully rebutted by Mr. Horvath.\n",
      "Defendant did not provide any rebuttal evidence to Event #2.\n",
      "Finally, Defendant argues that there is no evidence of any negative work\n",
      "evaluation to support Event #3. Again, this appears to be a recital of arguments\n",
      "supra. The undersigned would again reiterate that Defendant raised a good faith\n",

      "THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE FINDINGS OF\n",
      "FACT THAT PD, APPORTIONMENT AND ATTONEY FEES\n",
      "SHOULD BE DEFERRED\n",
      "Here, Defendant begins by arguing that Dr. Sherrill found no industrial\n",
      "injury; however, the undersigned did not rely on the report of Dr. Sherrill as\n",
      "outlined in the Findings of Fact. Defendant also raised two additional issues: a)\n",
      "Dr. Nehorayan did not review treatment records between 2016 through 2020 and\n",
      "b) Dr. Nehorayan is not a treating physician and was used for an AOE/COE\n",
      "evaluation.\n",
      "a. Failure to Review Treating Reports\n",
      "Defendant's argument that Dr. Nehorayan's report does not meet the\n",
      "threshold for a compensable report for failure to review some treating reports\n",
      "would also negate the report of the QME, Dr. Sherrill, upon which Defendant\n",
      "relies for the same reasons. While a medical report may not have an accurate\n",
      "medical history if the doctor has not reviewed all of the medical reports, it is not\n",
      "dispositive that failure to review every medical report results in an inaccurate\n",
      "medical history. In Kyles, the court found that a report was not accurate when a\n",
      "doctor concluded certain rehabilitative treatment probably would be ineffective.\n",
      "Kyles v. WCAB, 195 Cal. App.3d 614, 621. The doctor, however, had not\n",
      "reviewed the medical records of the employee's treatment to that point. Id. The\n",
      "Court of Appeal found that the opinion \"made in the absence of a review of all\n",
      "of the medical records, particularly those of petitioner's treating orthopedist,\n",
      "could not be accepted as substantial evidence.\" Id. However, a failure to review\n",

      "a battery of tests and engaged in an extensive discussion and review of\n",
      "Applicant's history. Accordingly, the undersigned finds that failure to review\n",
      "some treating records does not render his opinion insubstantial.\n",
      "b. Dr. Nehorayan is not a Treating Physician\n",
      "Defendant appears to be arguing for the first time in its Petition for\n",

      "consults with a doctor at his or her own expense, in the course of seeking medical\n",
      "treatment, the resulting report is admissible. Id. This is because Labor Code\n",
      "section 4061(i) permits admission of an evaluation prepared by a treating\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The above entitled matter was originally tried and submitted before the undersigned\n",
      "judge on November 13, 2019. I awarded partial attorney fees to the cost petitioner\n",
      "for Dr. Konstat's representation. Defendant filed a Petition for Reconsideration,\n",
      "objecting to any award of attorney fees as part of their argument. The WCAB\n",
      "granted the Petition, which resulted in another Petition for Reconsideration, but\n",
      "filed by cost petitioner, Dr. Konstat's, attorney, Ms. Kapelnikov. The matter was\n",
      "then remanded to the trial level before the undersigned WCJ on the issue of whether\n",
      "Defendant acted in bad faith to warrant \"sanctionable conduct\" which could then\n",
      "result in cost petitioner's attorney's fees being reimbursed by Defendant.\n",
      "The matter was submitted the second time on February 9, 2022 with a Findings and\n",
      "Order issuing on April 8, 2022, this time concluding that not only did Defendant\n",
      "not act in bad faith, but that no award of attorney fees would issue. Ms. Kapelnikov\n",
      "filed a Petition for Reconsideration on April 27, 2022, again arguing that Defendant\n",
      "acted in bad faith and that its behavior was sanctionable which warrants an award\n",
      "attorney fees. The Defendant did not file an Answer.\n",
      "Based upon a review of the entire record and the subject Petition, it is respectfully\n",
      "recommended that the Petition be denied.\n",
      "II. Facts and Discussion on Sanctions and Attorney Fees\n",
      "I issued a Findings and Order dated April 8, 2022, and found, once again, that\n",
      "Defendant did not act in bad faith, and that no sanctions were warranted, and so no\n",
      "attorney's fees were awarded either per former CCR Sections 10451.1(g)(1)(A)&(B)\n",
      "and 10561 (now 10421) and LC Section 5813. I originally found that cost petitioner\n",
      "should receive some attorney fees for the work done to effectuate the settlement\n",
      "with Defendant of Dr. Konstat's billing in mid-2019 when the petition for non-IBR\n",
      "Determination was filed on 3/5/2019. This is what triggered Defendant to discover\n",
      "the unit error of 7 vs. 74 for the first time, as the original request for secondary bill\n",
      "review the year before indicated the billing was erroneously down-coded from an\n",
      "ML104 to an ML101. That's why when the secondary bill review was requested,\n",
      "the bill review results of 4/24/18 indicated that Dr. Konstat's billing was duplicative\n",
      "and no further monies were owed, even though this second bill review showed 74\n",
      "units. It was because the secondary bill review only requested an analysis under\n",
      "ML104, not ML101. It was not until the March 2019 non-IBR petition was served\n",
      "that Defendant discovered the 7 vs. 74 unit discrepancy issue.\n",
      "After the petition issued in March 2019, the parties quickly negotiated a settlement\n",
      "for $6,190.79 for the entirety of Dr. Konstat's billing, including sanctions, penalties\n",
      "and interest. The settlement left open the issue of attorney fees.\n",
      "I found that when Defendant resolved the Dr. Konstat bill in April 2019, it was\n",
      "acting in good faith. Part of former CCR Section 10451.1(g)(1) is that due to bad\n",
      "faith actions or tactics, or if a defendant fails to comply with timeliness\n",
      "requirements, they shall be liable for the provider's attorney fees. Bad faith actions\n",
      "may include failure to pay an uncontested portion of a medical-legal bill, or failing\n",
      "to make a good faith effort to timely comply. LC Section 5813 sanctions include\n",
      "when a party taking a position intended to harass or injury or done solely to cause\n",
      "unnecessary delay or needless increase in litigation costs. It also looks to whether\n",
      "there is no reasonable excuse or where there is a pattern of conduct. See CCR former\n",
      "Section 10561.\n",
      "The point is that Defendant, while it underpaid originally, did not know it had\n",
      "underpaid until mid-March 2019. Then it settled the entire bill with the provider a\n",
      "month later, well within the 60 days to make a payment, if they were to re-run the\n",
      "billing using the 74 unit codes instead of the 7. It was never about a billing of ML\n",
      "104 versus an ML 101. Neither party knew or discovered this, including Dr. Konstat\n",
      "apparently, until about March 2019. In fact, in the secondary bill review request\n",
      "and IBR request (which was denied because it was deemed untimely and not based\n",
      "on the merits), the issue of 7 vs. 74 was not raised.\n",
      "Then there is the IBR request of 5/24/2018 which was clearly based on the same\n",
      "presumed reduction- from an ML104 to an ML101. But this had never happened.\n",
      "Even the petitioner did not know or notice at the time about the unit error and\n",
      "thought they had simply been down coded erroneously from an ML104 to an ML1\n",
      "01. And that is why when Defendant received the second bill review request, it did\n",
      "not allow for more fees - it was because the Appeal concentrated on the ML104 vs.\n",
      "ML101 issue.\n",
      "I am aware the language of the code indicates \"shall be subject to attorney fees\",\n",
      "costs, etc., but I also do not read the statute strictly so as to forgive mistakes versus\n",
      "acts clearly done in bad faith and the legislative intent. This was obviously a clerical\n",
      "error which was rectified when the non-IBR petition was received and defendant\n",
      "took immediate remedial measures to correct the situation and settle the bill within\n",
      "30 days. I will not punish a party for correcting its errors right away upon\n",
      "discovering them. I even note in the 4/12/2019 emails between Resolution Partners\n",
      "and the provider's attorney (which was pointed out by petitioner itself at the\n",
      "Reconsideration, page 3), that Ms. Long of Resolution Partners indicated they\n",
      "would negotiate the attorney fees but stated, \"I do want to take care of the doctor\n",
      "asap.\" To me, that is nothing close to \"bad faith\" warranting an attorney fee award.\n",
      "The defendant did not maliciously or intentionally underpay this bill or change the\n",
      "codes to reduce it somehow. If knowledge and intent is not attributed to the\n",
      "Defendant, nor a pattern or course of conduct, then neither can it be found that they\n",
      "acted in bad faith, frivolously, or with intent to delay, harass, costs, etc.\n",
      "Another factor to consider on the lack of finding of bad faith or sanctionable\n",
      "conduct here was that when Defendant resolved the bill of the medical-legal\n",
      "provider in April 2019, it was paid in full plus penalties and interest. If Defendant\n",
      "intended to harass, delay, underpay, or avoid the provider in any way, they would\n",
      "not have voluntarily and so easily have paid it in full within 30 days, plus the\n",
      "requested penalties and interest, unless Defendant recognized immediately that it\n",
      "had made such a mistake. Most Defendants (at least in the Los Angeles area) would\n",
      "attempt to reduce and negotiate this bill, even in the face of such a mistake, but this\n",
      "Defendant did not.\n",
      "Petitioner's attorney also argues at page 5 of the Reconsideration that it was also\n",
      "bad faith actions or tactics when Ms. Long of Resolution Partners allegedly failed\n",
      "or refused to negotiate further on her attorney fee demand after Dr. Konstat's bill\n",
      "was resolved in April 2019. The fact is defendant found the $350 hourly rate\n",
      "claimed as unreasonable given the experience and years of practice of the attorney\n",
      "representing the provider. It was also an inflated amount of time stated. But the\n",
      "issues cannot be muddled here - the issue was whether defendant acted in bad faith\n",
      "when it mistakenly underpaid Dr. Konstat's bill, requiring her to hire an attorney\n",
      "and file the non-IBR petition. The issue was not whether Defendant refused or\n",
      "failed to negotiate with the attorney on her own bills after the doctor was resolved.\n",
      "I agreed with Defendant that the hourly rate and time spent (claimed) was excessive\n",
      "and I originally awarded fees but at a reduced amount. However, if one could claim\n",
      "\"bad faith\" and sanctions on every party that did not return emails or phone calls or\n",
      "negotiate further, the legal system would be bogged down for 100 years in advance.\n",
      "Cost petitioner did what it is legally entitled to do, and should do, to prosecute its\n",
      "fee demand - file a DOR to get on the WCAB calendar and try the issue before a\n",
      "judge.\n",
      "Petitioner also argues in its petition that under LC Section 5811, it is owed attorney\n",
      "fees, but this section specifically deals with interpreters for medical-legal services\n",
      "and billing. It does not pertain to Dr. Konstat. It also does not pertain to where\n",
      "clerical errors have been made that neither party knew of until a year later.\n",
      "Also, I have to point out that the provider, up until March 2019, had subjected itself\n",
      "to the IBR process and as far as the Defendant was concerned, its IBR request of\n",
      "April 2018 was denied as untimely in May 2018, so Defendant would have deemed\n",
      "the issue resolved and would have had no way of even knowing that a cost petition\n",
      "was going to be filed 10 or 11 months later as an alternative path for the PQME to\n",
      "collect her funds. They also could have simply contacted defendant by letter or\n",
      "email or phone call to bring their attention to the unit error issue. This was\n",
      "essentially the provider's \"second bite at the apple\" and still the Defendant paid it\n",
      "in full plus penalties and interest. In other words, the very first time Defendant\n",
      "became aware of the mistake was in mid-March 2019, and the issue was resolved\n",
      "in a few weeks.\n",
      "Therefore, on remand on the limited issue of sanctionable conduct warranting\n",
      "attorney fees, I incorporate my prior Findings and Award and Order, as well as the\n",
      "present one from April 2022, to conclude Defendant did not act in bad faith here\n",
      "and no sanctions are warranted. If no sanctions would be awarded for bad faith\n",
      "conduct, then no attorney fees could be awarded either. If the fees must be based\n",

      "02/18/2021 is in evidence as Exhibit A-2. On pages 13, 14, 15 and 17, Dr.\n",
      "Jacobs explained why he was requesting diagnostic imaging studies for the\n",
      "shoulders, knees and cervical spine. He described \"limited\" previous studies for\n",
      "the shoulders, stating that no \"fresh or recent studies were available.\" He noted\n",
      "that the diagnostic studies for the knees obtained by a previous examiner, Dr.\n",
      "Williams, were outdated and that \"fresh weight bearing films and or MRI studies\n",

      "We first address the timeliness of this Opinion. Labor Code¹ section 5909 provides that a\n",
      "petition for reconsideration is deemed denied unless the Appeals Board acts on the petition within\n",
      "60 days of filing. (§ 5909.) Applicant filed his Petition for Reconsideration on February 28, 2022.\n",
      "The Appeals Board had until April 29, 2022 to act on the Petition. However, the Appeals Board\n",

      "for reconsideration because the Appeals Board had not acted on the petition within the statutory\n",
      "time limits of section 5909. The Appeals Board did not act on applicant's petition because it had\n",
      "misplaced the file, through no fault of the parties. The Court of Appeal reversed the Appeals\n",
      "Board's decision holding that the time to act on applicant's petition was tolled during the period\n",
      "1 Subsequent statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise indicated.\n",
      "2\n",
      "that the file was misplaced. (Id. at p. 1108.) Like the Court in Shipley, \"we are not convinced that\n",

      "considering that applicant filed a timely petition for reconsideration on February 28, 2022 and that\n",
      "our failure to act was due to a procedural error, we find that our time to act on applicant's petition\n",

      "per section 5909, the deadline to act on this Petition is extended to July 5, 2022. Therefore, this\n",

      "PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION\n",
      "I. INTRODUCTION\n",
      "The injured employee is a 46 year old roofing supply dispatcher, roofer, driver\n",
      "and sales representative who sustained injuries at work during the period 1988\n",
      "through 2/10/2014 to his low back, left shoulder and right knee.\n",
      "The Petitioner is the Defendant who claims that the undersigned erred by finding\n",
      "injury to the left shoulder and right knee.\n",
      "This matter was originally tried in 2018 and 2019 as the result of priority\n",
      "hearings on the issue of injury.\n",
      "Thereafter injury to the low back was found. The only issues at this trial were\n",
      "injury to the left shoulder and right knee.\n",
      "II. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n",
      "The claim by the Applicant was for injury by way of cumulative trauma during\n",
      "his 26 years of employment with the Defendant. Two prior trials established\n",
      "that the employee sustained injuries from 1988 to 2/10/214 to his low back. Dr.\n",
      "Nader Farsar acted as the PQME in this case (Court's Exs. X-1 – 4). Dr. Shiva\n",
      "Drakshani first saw the patient on an attorney referral on 11/13/2015 (App's Ex.\n",
      "1). Dr. Edwin Haronian saw the patient on an orthopedic referral from Drakshani\n",
      "on 6/10/2016 (Df's Ex. D). Applicant testified at trial on 7/30/2018 that he\n",
      "developed right knee, low back and left shoulder complaints while working\n",
      "(Minutes of Hearing, 7/30/2018, p.3, line 3).\n",
      "Drs. Haronian, Drakshani and Farsar all agreed that the employee has sustained\n",
      "cumulative trauma to the left shoulder and right knee as well as the low back.\n",
      "In prior hearings there were significant disputes as to date of injury, body parts\n",
      "and job duties. These disputes were resolved by the Decision After\n",
      "Reconsideration dated 9/30/2019. At that point the findings of fact found that\n",
      "injury was to the low back. Injury to other body parts was deferred.\n",
      "The trial conducted on 5/4/2022 was solely on the issue of injury to the left\n",
      "shoulder and right knee. No new evidence was proffered.\n",
      "Based upon the opinions of Drs. Farsar, Haronian and Drakshani the\n",
      "undersigned found that the Applicant herein did sustain injury to his left shoulder\n",
      "and right knee. No other issues were before the Court.\n",
      "III. DISCUSSION\n",
      "6\n",
      "A finding of injury must be based upon substantial medical evidence. The\n",
      "evidence must be sufficient so that a reasonable mind might find the evidence to\n",
      "be adequate to support a medical conclusion. Braewood Convalescent Hospital\n",
      "v. WCAB (Bolton) (1983) 48 CCC 566. Such opinions must be credible and not\n",
      "based on inadequate medical histories, surmise, conjecture or guess. Place v.\n",
      "WCAB (1970) 35 CCC 575.\n",
      "A finding of fact must also be based on a review of all the evidence and not\n",
      "simply upon an isolated fact that disregards the entire record. Bracken v. WCAB\n",
      "(1989) 54 CCC 349.\n",
      "In this case the Petitioner urges a finding that the evidence is not substantial to\n",
      "support the finding of injury to the right knee or left shoulder.\n",
      "The basis of the appeal on the left shoulder is that the Applicant's testimony in\n",
      "deposition is inconsistent with regards to the left shoulder claim.\n",
      "The basis for the appeal of the right knee is based upon the claim that Applicant\n",
      "previously had undergone right knee surgery 20 years earlier.\n",
      "Left Shoulder\n",
      "There was inconsistent testimony on the shoulder claim in the deposition.\n",
      "However the undersigned took note of Dr. Farsar's report (Ex. X-1) which noted\n",
      "that this unsophisticated claimant told him that he had right shoulder complaints\n",
      "but pointed to his left shoulder (Ex. X-1, p.4).\n",
      "More importantly, the complaints to Drs. Drakshani and Haronian were to the\n",
      "left shoulder. Applicant's testimony indicated complaints in the left shoulder.\n",
      "Even more importantly, the findings by all doctors were in the left shoulder. Dr.\n",
      "Farsar found range of motion abnormalities in the left shoulder (Ex. X-1, p.6).\n",
      "There were no findings on the right shoulder. In fact Dr. Farsar declared\n",
      "Applicant P&S with 5% wpi in the left shoulder.\n",
      "Dr. Haronian received a history of left shoulder complaints (Ex. D, p.3). His\n",
      "conclusions were that Applicant suffered from an impingement of the left\n",
      "shoulder (p.8).\n",
      "So while there may have been confusion, the preponderance of the evidence by\n",
      "the physicians clearly favors a finding of injury to the left shoulder. The lack of\n",
      "any findings on the right shoulder dispels the theory that injury was on the right.\n",
      "Right Knee\n",
      "All physicians were told about the prior right knee surgery many years earlier.\n",
      "So the histories received by the physicians herein were correct. What may likely\n",
      "7\n",
      "result in apportionment issues later on in the litigation does not negate the\n",
      "opinion on causation put forth by all three physicians in this matter.\n",
      "Dr. Farsar found pain, loss of strength, loss of range of motion and arthrogram\n",
      "abnormalities to substantiate the findings of injury to the right knee (Ex. X-1, p.\n",
      "9).\n",
      "Dr. Haronian's right knee exam is in agreement with Dr. Farsar (Ex. D, p.7).\n",
      "The Applicant worked in an occupation from 1988 to 1997 that would be\n",
      "considered very arduous. Thereafter the evidence supported the finding that\n",
      "Applicant worked until 2014 performing similar physical activities on a lessor\n",
      "extent due to a change of jobs. The physicians received accurate histories and\n",
      "made identical findings of injury, need for care and disabilities. Hence the\n",
      "preponderance of evidence supports the finding of injury to the left shoulder and\n",
      "right knee.\n",

      "While she has received 12 sessions of physical therapy and five sessions of\n",
      "occupational therapy, this has not been adequate. In discussion with her, it sounds\n",
      "like there has been quite a bit of delay in the therapy and no continuity of care\n",

      "The QME reevaluated applicant approximately one year later, on May 21, 2018. Dr. Kaplan\n",
      "noted applicant's condition to have worsened, and that an in-patient hospitalization would be\n",
      "necessary. Dr. Kaplan wrote, “[b]ecause of the lack of appropriate care, her relatively mild\n",

      "completely worthless. Had she received timely appropriate care, I do not think she would be\n",

      "that applicant \"is not able to compete, or to be retrained for any suitable gainful employment, and\n",
      "is not amenable to vocational rehabilitation.” (Ex. 4, report of Broadus & Assoc., dated May 21,\n",

      "On October 1, 2019, QME Dr. Kaplan reevaluated applicant, and following his clinical\n",

      "upper extremity,\" and that applicant had further developed adhesive capsulitis of the right shoulder\n",
      "and de Quervain's tendinitis of the right wrist. Dr. Kaplan concluded that applicant was \"totally\n",

      "agree with its conclusions.\" (Ex. DD, report of Daniel Kaplan, M.D., dated October 1, 2019, p. 4.)\n",
      "The parties selected QME Rosabel Young, M.D. to report on applicant's alleged\n",
      "neurological complaints. Dr. Young evaluated applicant on February 18, 2020, and diagnosed\n",
      "hyperesthesia of the left arm, rather than Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. (Ex. BB, report of\n",
      "PQME Rosabel Young, M.D., dated February 18, 2020.) The QME identified neurological\n",
      "3\n",
      "impairment to the left arm and headaches with industrial causation, and deemed applicant\n",
      "permanent and stationary. (Id. at p. 36.)\n",
      "On April 2, 2020, the parties undertook the deposition of orthopedic QME Dr. Kaplan. The\n",
      "QME reiterated his opinion that the lack of timely and proper medical treatment affected the\n",
      "applicant's outcome. (Ex. AA, transcript of the deposition of Daniel Kaplan, dated April 24, 2020,\n",
      "at 14:22.) When asked to expand on his diagnosis of CRPS, Dr. Kaplan responded that his\n",
      "assessment arose out of findings of \"markedly decreased range of motion of the shoulder and\n",
      "elbow, excessive tenderness to palpations, paraspinous spasm, changes in the appearance of her\n",
      "skin, [and] limited range of motion in her fingers.” Dr. Kaplan reiterated his opinion that applicant\n",
      "was permanent and totally disabled, explaining that applicant's disability arose out of the \"absence\n",
      "of any use of her left upper extremity due to the reflex dystrophy and then she is markedly limited\n",
      "in use of her right upper extremity due to the tendinitis of her right shoulder, adhesive capsulitis\n",
      "of her right shoulder, and tendinitis of the right wrist.” (Id. at 23:20.) The QME was also asked\n",
      "whether additional treatment would alter applicant's status as permanent and stationary:\n",
      "If she got treatment and improved. If she got treatment and there was no change\n",
      "in her condition, then she would still be P&S. So if treatment afforded her\n",
      "improvement, then she might be considered to no longer be P&S. (Id. at 30:14).\n",
      "On April 28, 2020, neurology QME Dr. Young issued a supplemental report, noting again\n",
      "that she felt applicant did not meet the diagnostic criteria for CRPS, that applicant had paresthesia\n",
      "and allodynia, but not vascular color changes or persistent swelling. (Ex. CC, report of PQME\n",
      "Rosabel Young, M.D., dated April 28, 2020, p. 14.) After a review of additional records, Dr. Young\n",
      "made no changes to her prior opinions or reporting. (Id. at p. 15.)\n",
      "Trial commenced on April 28, 2021 and continued on June 17, 2021, with the parties\n",
      "framing issues relevant to the nature and extent of the injury. Following submission of the matter\n",
      "for decision, the WCJ issued rating instructions, which were served along with the formal ratings\n",
      "determination on the parties on January 18, 2022.\n",
      "In the April 12, 2022 F&A, the WCJ excluded multiple defense exhibits for failure of\n",

      "testimony to decreased medication usage. (Petition, at 7:12.) Defendant asserts that as a result,\n",
      "applicant is not permanent and stationary. (Petition, at 6:20.) However, applicant also testified at\n",
      "trial that she could not remember the names of some of her medications or dosages. (Minutes, at\n",
      "10:4.) Applicant testified that she is in constant pain, that her medication usage is dependent on\n",
      "her pain levels, and that the medication makes her sleepy. (Minutes, at 4:1, 9:21.) Defendant puts\n",
      "forward no medical opinion or evidence from any treating or evaluating physician that documents\n",
      "a material change in applicant's condition. Nor does the record reveal any significant alteration in\n",
      "applicant's physical abilities, activities of daily living, significant interim medical treatment, or\n",
      "other indicia of changed condition. Accordingly, we agree with the WCJ that applicant remains\n",
      "permanent and stationary.\n",
      "Defendant contends that the reporting of applicant's vocational expert Mr. Broadus is not\n",
      "substantial evidence. (Petition, at 8:16.) However, the formal ratings instructions issued by the\n",
      "WCJ yielded 100% permanent disability without reliance on vocational evidence. (January 14,\n",

      "reflects no objection lodged by any party to the ratings instructions or the resulting Report of\n",

      "Defendant asserts that the record does not support the diagnosis of CRPS, because\n",
      "orthopedic QME Dr. Kaplan identified seven rather than eight objective criteria necessary to the\n",
      "diagnosis, as set forth in the AMA Guides, Fifth Edition, and that neurology QME Dr. Young\n",

      "Rosabel Young, M.D., dated February 18, 2020, p. 32.) In deposition, Dr. Kaplan responded to the\n",
      "differences in diagnosis as follows:\n",
      "Well, CRPS is a very frustrating problem in the medical/legal world because, as\n",
      "I testified earlier, there's no test to make the call. It's a clinical diagnosis. So you\n",
      "could have two clinicians who are both experts in the field and they may disagree\n",
      "on the diagnosis of CRPS in a given individual because the diagnosis is made\n",
      "based on clinical suspicion and clinical findings rather than a black-and-white\n",
      "test. So your characterization of the neurologist's report doesn't surprise me. I\n",
      "think you could find other examiners who would say she has CRPS, other\n",
      "examiners who would say she has a frozen shoulder. You can have both. She can\n",
      "have a frozen shoulder and CRPS. So I think it's going to be difficult to get a\n",
      "consensus from multiple different examiners of what's going on because each\n",
      "person can provide the factual basis to support their diagnosis and it doesn't mean\n",
      "I'm right and he's wrong or vice versa unfortunately. (Ex. AA, transcript of the\n",
      "deposition of Daniel Kaplan, M.D., dated April 24, 2020, at 25:12.)\n",
      "Irrespective of the specific diagnosis reached, there is broad agreement among the treating\n",
      "physicians and medical-legal evaluators with regard to the severity of applicant's injury. Dr.\n",
      "Kaplan observes that applicant \"has absence of any use of her left upper extremity due to the reflex\n",

      "of her right shoulder, adhesive capsulitis of her right shoulder, and tendinitis of the right wrist.\"\n",
      "(Id., at 23:20.) Pain management physician Dr. Kohan notes applicant “cannot and does not use\n",
      "the [left upper] extremity at all for self-care and daily activities,\" and that applicant cannot \"ever\n",
      "compete in the open job market and should be considered totally and permanently disabled.” (Ex.\n",

      "We also observe that this reporting is generally consonant with applicant's trial testimony\n",
      "that she cannot \"function or take care of herself most days,\" which the WCJ found to be forthright\n",
      "and fully credible. (Minutes, at 6:2; Report, at p. 11.) We accord to the WCJ's credibility\n",

      "(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312 [35 Cal.Comp.Cases 500].) Additionally, and despite a different diagnosis,\n",

      "of applicant's functional abilities across a range of medical specialties. Because the aggregate\n",

      "Defendant also contends that applicant's failure to \"fully participate\" in physical therapy\n",
      "due to pain-related complaints was unreasonable, and entitles defendant to a reduction in disability.\n",
      "(Petition, at 17:1.) However, \"the question as to whether the employee has acted reasonably or not\n",

      "At trial, Applicant credibly testified that QME Dr. Whitelaw's history (report dated\n",
      "11/18/20, Ex. A-17) was correct: that he had longstanding, chronic strain/sprain in both wrists\n",
      "from turning keys in his job as a correctional officer. However, he was never taken off work for\n",
      "this, did not see a doctor for these problems, and no doctor told him before Dr. Whitelaw that he\n",
      "injured his hands due to his work. He did file a claim for cumulative trauma to his hands and wrists\n",
      "caused by his work through his last day on the job, 7/10/12, and the symptoms, including loss of\n",

      "is the date upon which the worker first suffered disability and either knew, or with reasonable\n",

      "Whether the pain during work or the use of neoprene supports was a \"disability\" is a subject\n",
      "that requires the expertise of a physician. The medical expertise for determining disability and its\n",
      "cause first came from Dr. Whitelaw, as far as the evidence shows. Likewise, the necessary\n",

      "of the parks on foot. He picks up paper, empties garbage cans, mows the lawn,\n",

      "this job for a long time. He has left knee problems currently. His left knee is\n",

      "in and out of the truck. He is short and this twisted his knee over the years. His\n",
      "left knee hurt a little before but he did not take it seriously. In the past he would\n",
      "take a three day weekend to relax. Then early last year his left knee got to the\n",
      "point where he could not walk. When he cannot walk, he does not go into work.\n",
      "He will work a week or three and a half days before it becomes too painful. He\n",

      "302 pounds. He had left leg problems on and off for about eight years. They said\n",

      "I have reviewed defendant's Petition, the Answer, and the entire record in\n",
      "this matter. Based upon my review, I recommend that reconsideration be denied.\n",
      "FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n",
      "The factual background of this case, as set forth at pages 1-5 of the\n",
      "Opinion on Decision (Opinion), is as follows:\n",
      "At trial, applicant testified on direct examination that\n",
      "11/11/18 is the approximate date of first injury. It was resolved via\n",
      "stipulations in May of 2020. Her left wrist, right shoulder and\n",
      "tailbone were injured then.\n",
      "She has another injury date when she reinjured her shoulder\n",
      "in August of 2020. She was in another position where she was\n",
      "repetitively moving her shoulder. It was later determined that this\n",
      "was a new claim. She was not sent to see a physician for this injury.\n",
      "She was told the claim was denied because it was not deemed a new\n",
      "injury. She was off work for a short period but was able to work\n",
      "with accommodations. Her right shoulder worsened with range of\n",
      "motion and pain.\n",
      "She was seen by Dr. Chow on 10/1/21, and was given\n",
      "additional restrictions. She emailed this to Ashley Stevens, at her\n",
      "employer, and to their HR person, Eleanor Bruton. They could not\n",
      "accommodate her after that through today.\n",
      "She was called before the Christmas break, by someone she\n",
      "had never spoken to before at VCUSD, who asked if she was seen\n",
      "on 12/1/21.\n",
      "She got a pay raise when she got a promotion to high school\n",
      "office manager, which was negotiated by her union.\n",
      "2\n",
      "She was off work for a non-industrial condition on 8/20/21.\n",
      "She was paid partial pay from 10/1/21, which is much less\n",
      "than her TD rate.\n",
      "On cross-examination, applicant stated that the ending date\n",
      "of the non-industrial condition is 11/17/21. She was taken off work\n",
      "for this by Dr. Fulton. She was last seen by Dr. Fulton on November\n",
      "of 2021. At that time, there was no discussion of extending the non-\n",
      "industrial disability leave. She has a follow-up appointment with\n",
      "Dr. Fulton at the end of January of 2022.\n",
      "She recalls seeing Dr. Renbaum, the AME. She doesn't\n",
      "recall the level of pain then, but it was less than it is now. Regarding\n",
      "the frequency of pain in shoulder, she doesn't recall, either.\n",
      "She doesn't recall an increase in her shoulder pain just before\n",
      "the August 2020 event. Her shoulder pain worsened after August of\n",
      "2020. Her shoulder condition hasn't gotten better since then. Her\n",
      "range of motion is now limited. It pops and is much more painful\n",
      "and impacts her sleep and other parts of her life.\n",
      "Dr. Tang, in November of 2020, had her on work\n",
      "restrictions, and they were the same that she had for a long period.\n",
      "She believes her lifting restriction was at ten pounds then. It's more\n",
      "extensive now.\n",
      "She never returned to full duty after the first injury.\n",
      "The 10/1/21 report by Dr. Chow (1 page) was provided to\n",
      "her employer that same day. She doesn't know if it lists her date of\n",
      "injury. She didn't provide a more comprehensive report to her\n",
      "employer. There is an 11/1/21 fax imprint date, but that's nothing\n",
      "she ever faxed. She hasn't discussed this report with her employer\n",
      "since 10/1/21.\n",
      "The last date she worked for VCUSD was 8/13/21. She\n",
      "worked full time up until then. The school work year started 8/1/21.\n",
      "She was taken off work on 8/13/21 due to arm pain from\n",
      "working the day before. She was seen in the emergency department,\n",
      "where she received a Toradal shot, and was taken off of work for\n",
      "five days.\n",
      "3\n",
      "She was then seen by her psychologist for a regularly-set\n",
      "appointment, and the psychologist took her off of work.\n",
      "The shoulder has now become more symptomatic.\n",
      "On 8/12/21, she believes she overused the shoulder. It had\n",
      "been hurting her for several days before that. She tried to be seen\n",
      "by a workers' compensation doctor but was unable to do so for a\n",
      "time.\n",
      "Regarding Exhibit Q, the report of Dr. Tolentino, dated\n",
      "5/25/21, she attempted to make a follow-up appointment but was\n",
      "unable to do so. Dr. Tolentino didn't have records or Kaiser\n",
      "information and she couldn't do anything for her. She was upset\n",
      "because Dr. Tolentino could not help her or give her any treatment.\n",
      "Since 10/1/21, she got some pay from VCUSD and some\n",
      "disability from private insurance, in the amount of $1,300, from\n",
      "American Fidelity that she pays for and gets through her employer.\n",
      "This covered from 8/20/21 - 11/7/21 for her psychiatric condition.\n",
      "From VCUSD, she got $1,000 for September and $2,000 for\n",
      "October. She received a partial payment for November, which she\n",
      "believes was $2,000. These payments are made by the employer,\n",
      "per the union agreement. She believes this is a short-term disability\n",
      "leave, and this is nothing that she pays for.\n",
      "Dr. Renbaum hasn't addressed her August 2020 injury.\n",
      "When she was seen by Dr. Chow, she doesn't recall if she\n",
      "told him about Dr. Renbaum's permanent and stationary\n",
      "determination. They discussed the August 2020 injury and the\n",
      "change in her condition. He didn't differentiate whether work\n",
      "restrictions were from her first injury versus her second injury.\n",
      "Since 8/13/21, she hasn't worked for anyone else. No\n",
      "activities outside of work since August of 2021 have increased her\n",
      "pain.\n",
      "Her last physical therapy appointment was last week.\n",
      "On re-direct examination, she testified that the 8/28/20\n",
      "injury was denied before she was first seen by Dr. Chow. She\n",
      "doesn't know if he was authorized to treat her for the second injury.\n",

      "21, 2020.\n",

      "arbitrator does not justify the Findings of Fact and the Findings of Fact do not support the Findings\n",
      "and Award. They also allege the arbitrator acted without or in excess of his powers.\n",
      "At the arbitration, the parties agreed that Conagra Foods was the special employer for the\n",
      "applicant. The applicant was performing duties under the supervision, control, and direction of the\n",
      "special employer Conagra Foods.\n",
      "Conagra, a self-insured employer contends they are not considered other insurance and that\n",
      "is the reason why the arbitration decision should be overturned.\n",
      "CIGA in their Answer to Petition for Reconsideration stated Conagra is other insurance\n",
      "within the meaning of insurance Code Section 1063.lc (9) and that CIGA has no liability in this\n",

      "December 21, 2020.\n",
      "Defendant CIGA filed a timely and verified Answer to Petition for Reconsideration on\n",

      "This case involves a specific injury on January 20, 2014.\n",
      "The sole issue is coverage.\n",
      "Pursuant to agreement at the arbitration Conagra Foods was the special employer for the\n",
      "applicant on the date of injury.\n",
      "Conagra contends there is no mechanism for a self-insured employer to obtain an\n",

      "special employer.\n",
      "4\n",
      "CIGA contends there is joint and several liability between the special employer Conagra\n",
      "and the general employer CIGA. CIGA contends that self-insurance is other insurance within the\n",
      "meaning of Insurance Code Section 1063.1©(9). Therefore, they allege they have no liability for\n",
      "this claim as CIGA is not in fact an insurance company and if there is other insurance the claims\n",
      "administration and coverage liability would be placed upon Conagra the special employer.\n",
      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "Conagra in their Petition for Reconsideration states they have fully complied with the laws\n",
      "related to self-insurance which limit coverage to its own employees and excludes coverage for\n",
      "employees of other companies. They admit they were not able to obtain an exclusionary\n",
      "endorsement which would have denied coverage where they were found to be the special\n",
      "employer.\n",
      "Conagra admits there is no mechanism for a self-insured employer to obtain an\n",
      "endorsement from the insurance commissioner excluding employees working at Conagra as a\n",
      "special employer.\n",
      "For matters of coverage there is no distinction between a private insurance company and a\n",
      "self-insured employer. Both are state mandated policies to cover all California workers with\n",
      "workers compensation insurance.\n",
      "Conagra Foods did not have an exclusionary policy form filed with the state which would\n",
      "exclude any temporary staffing employees who worked at Conagra.\n",
      "Due to the fact there is admitted special employment CIGA was relieved of the\n",
      "responsibility for coverage as there is other insurance under Insurance Code Section 1063.10 (9).\n",

    "There is one case involved in this proceeding. It is a specific injury of January 20, 2014.\n",
    "Defendant Conagra Foods filed a timely and verified Petition for Reconsideration on December\n",
    "21, 2020.\n",
    "Defendant California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) filed an Answer to Petition\n",
    "for Reconsideration timely and verified on January 5, 2021.\n",
    "Defendant Conagra Foods seeks reconsideration on the grounds that the decision of the\n",
    "arbitrator does not justify the Findings of Fact and the Findings of Fact do not support the Findings\n",
    "and Award. They also allege the arbitrator acted without or in excess of his powers.\n",
    "At the arbitration, the parties agreed that Conagra Foods was the special employer for the\n",
    "applicant. The applicant was performing duties under the supervision, control, and direction of the\n",
    "special employer Conagra Foods.\n",
    "Conagra, a self-insured employer contends they are not considered other insurance and that\n",
    "is the reason why the arbitration decision should be overturned.\n",
    "CIGA in their Answer to Petition for Reconsideration stated Conagra is other insurance\n",
    "within the meaning of insurance Code Section 1063.lc (9) and that CIGA has no liability in this\n",
    "matter.\n",
    "STATEMENT OF FACTS\n",
    "Defendant Conagra foods has filed a timely and verified Petition for Reconsideration on\n",
    "December 21, 2020.\n",
    "Defendant CIGA filed a timely and verified Answer to Petition for Reconsideration on\n",
    "January 5, 2021.\n",
    "This case involves a specific injury on January 20, 2014.\n",
    "The sole issue is coverage.\n",
    "Pursuant to agreement at the arbitration Conagra Foods was the special employer for the\n",
    "applicant on the date of injury.\n",
    "Conagra contends there is no mechanism for a self-insured employer to obtain an\n",
    "endorsement from the insurance commissioner excluding employees working at Conagra as a\n",
    "special employer.\n",
    "4\n",
    "CIGA contends there is joint and several liability between the special employer Conagra\n",
    "and the general employer CIGA. CIGA contends that self-insurance is other insurance within the\n",
    "meaning of Insurance Code Section 1063.1©(9). Therefore, they allege they have no liability for\n",
    "this claim as CIGA is not in fact an insurance company and if there is other insurance the claims\n",
    "administration and coverage liability would be placed upon Conagra the special employer.\n",
    "DISCUSSION\n",
    "Conagra in their Petition for Reconsideration states they have fully complied with the laws\n",
    "related to self-insurance which limit coverage to its own employees and excludes coverage for\n",
    "employees of other companies. They admit they were not able to obtain an exclusionary\n",
    "endorsement which would have denied coverage where they were found to be the special\n",
    "employer.\n",
    "Conagra admits there is no mechanism for a self-insured employer to obtain an\n",
    "endorsement from the insurance commissioner excluding employees working at Conagra as a\n",
    "special employer.\n",
    "For matters of coverage there is no distinction between a private insurance company and a\n",
    "self-insured employer. Both are state mandated policies to cover all California workers with\n",
    "workers compensation insurance.\n",
    "Conagra Foods did not have an exclusionary policy form filed with the state which would\n",
    "exclude any temporary staffing employees who worked at Conagra.\n",
    "Due to the fact there is admitted special employment CIGA was relieved of the\n",
    "responsibility for coverage as there is other insurance under Insurance Code Section 1063.10 (9).\n",
    "RECOMMENDATION\n",
    "For the reasons stated above, it is recommended the Petition for Reconsideration dated\n",
    "December 21, 2020 be denied.\n",
